Once upon a time, a peasant worked hard to make a living from his land. 
Every year his pear tree produced four basketfuls of fruit which had to be 
given to the king, a greedy ruler who grew rich at the expense of the poor.
   One year, part of the pear harvest went bad and the peasant was able to 
pick only three and a half baskets of fruit. The poor man was beside himself 
with fear, for the king refused to take less than four basketfuls, and the 
peasant would be cruelly punished.
   All he could do was put his youngest daughter into one of the baskets and 
cover her with a layer of pears, so that the basket looked full. The king's 
servants took away the four baskets without ever noticing the trick, and the 
little girl found herself all alone in the pantry, under the pears.
   One day, the cook went into the pantry and discovered her. Nobody could 
understand where on earth she had come from, and not knowing what to do with 
her, it was decided she should become a maid in the castle. Folk called her 
Violetta, for her eyes reminded them of the colour of violets.
   Violetta was a pretty girl, sweet and generous. One day, as she was 
watering the flowers in the royal gardens, she met the king's son, a youth of 
her own age, and the two became friends. The other maids, jealous of 
Violetta's beauty and of the affection many people in the castle felt for the 
girl, did everything they could to get her into trouble, by spreading nasty 
rumours about her. One day, the king sent for her and said severely:
   "I'm told you boast of being able to steal the witches' treasure trove. Is 
that true?" Violetta said 'no,' but the king refused to believe her and drove 
her out of his kingdom.
   "You may return only when you have laid hands on the treasure," he said. 
All Violetta's fondest friends, including the prince, were sorry to hear of 
the king's decision, but could do nothing to stop her going. The girl wandered
through the forest and, when she came to a pear tree, she climbed into its 
branches and fell asleep. She was wakened at dawn by an old woman calling her:
   "What are you doing up there, all by yourself?" Violetta told the old woman
her tale. She offered to help the little girl, gave her some round loaves, a 
broom, a little oil and some good advice, and the girl again set off. She 
reached a clearing with a large wood stove and saw three women tearing their 
hair, using it to sweep the ashes from the stove. Violetta offered them the 
broom and the women pointed out the way to the witches' palace.
   Suddenly, two hungry mastiffs blocked her path. Violetta threw them the 
loaves, the dogs ate them and let her pass. Then she came to the bank of a 
river in flood, but remembering the old woman's advice, she sang:
   Clear sparkling river
   Let me cross over,
and the minute her song wafted into the air, the water stopped flowing. 
Violetta thus crossed the river and at last reached the witches' palace. The 
door was unlocked, but Violetta could not push it open for the hinges were
rusted. So she rubbed on a little oil and the door swung open. The little girl
walked through the empty halls till she came to a splendid room in wich lay a
magnificent coffer full of jewels. Holding the coffer under her arm, Violetta 
made for the door, but the coffer, being enchanted, cried out:
   "Door! Don't let her out!" However, the door did open, for Violetta had
oiled the hinges. Down at the river, the coffer cried out. This time it said:
   "Water! Drown her!" But the river did not stop the little girl from 
crossing; the two mastiffs did not attack ant the three strange women did not
burn her in their stove. For each, in its own way, repaid the girl's courtesy.
Back at the king's palace again, the prince ran happily to meet Violetta,
telling her:
   "When my father asks you what you want as a reward, ask him for the basket 
of pears in the pantry!" And this Violetta did. Pleased at paying such a 
modest price, the king instantly ordered the humble basket to be brought. But 
nobody ever imagined for a minute that underneath the pears lay the prince. 
The young man came out of his hiding place, swore he was in love with Violetta
and that he wanted to marry her.
   In this way, the king was forced to give his consent. Violetta brought her 
family to court and they all began a new and happy life.

I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my

amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
   Far beyond the mountains bordering on the Shah's kingdom lay a great 
fertile plain, the realm of an old king, who had an only daughter named Gala. 
Gala was young and beautiful and so sweet and gentle that her father hated the
thought of letting her get married. The Court, however, was eager to see her a
bride. The king was very possessive and wanted to keep Gala all to himself, 
and with the help of a wizard, he had thought up a plan to discourage her 
suitors. A magic tree was planted in the garden, a huge pomegranate that had 
three fruits. At sunset, the branches bent over to touch the ground and the 
fruit split open. Inside each lay a soft feather bed. Gala, the princess, 
slept in the middle one, with her servants on each side. The fruit closed over
the maidens and the branches swung back to the sky, carrying the princess high
above all danger. Seven walls were built round the garden, each studded with 
thousands of spikes which nobody could ever cross. The king sent out a 
proclamation:
   "Any man wishing to marry my daughter must be noble, rich and handsome. But
he must also succeed in picking the fruit in which the princess sleeps. Yet, 
if he falters in trying to cross the seven circles of spikes, he will be left 
to die." As it so happens, the Shah's Chief Minister decided that the princess
would make a good wife for his master. As time went by, many flne brave 
warriors perished on the spikes guarding the enchanted garden. Saleb, however,
was sure that the special divine powers of the Shah would help him to overcome
any obstacle. So he wanted to persuade the Shah to try and win the princess's 
hand. Every day, Saleb described the trials men had to go through to reach the
king's daughter, and to begin with, the Shah was amused by such stories. Then
he became curious and began to ask questions himself. The clever Minister told
his master of the princess's beauty and all about her brave suitors. In the 
end, the Shah began to fall in love with the girl he had never seen, just by 
hearing so much about her. In no time at all, he began to pore over ways of 
reaching the fruit. And the Chief Minister was delighted to hear of the Shah's
plans.
   Next day, the Shah ordered a large, brightly feathered parrot with a strong
beak to be brought to him. He had decided to use his own magic powers, and he 
said to Saleb:
   "My soul is going to enter this parrot, but my lifeless bodyy wlll return. 
Watch over it day and night till I come back."
   After a long prayer to the God of Reason, the Shah did everything he had 
been told and fell into a deep sleep. His breathing grew fainter and fainter 
till it died away and he lay still on the bed. Watching worriedly, Saleb saw 
that the parrot, which had been sitting quietly on its perch, was now flapping
its wings wildly.
   The parrot quickly reached the mountain. The air was cold and he flapped
heavily upwards  but the highest peak was soon left behind. Far below lay the
turrets of the palace and the glinting of thousands of spikes. Somehow, the 
parrot struggled across tne rows of sharp steel and landed safely beside the 
magic tree.
   The sun was setting when Gala and her two servants stepped into the fruit
for the night. As the pomegranates closed, the calls of the three maidens rang
in the ears of the Parrot Shah, and in the second before they shut, he caught 
a fleeting glimpse of the beautiful princess. Her gleaming dark eyes seemed to
smile at him. Then the branches rose into the air and the fruit shrank back to
their normal size. As they pointed upwards, the parrot sprang into the air 
and, with a blow of his strong beak, ripped the pomegranate containing the 
princess from its branch. Clutching the fruit in his claws, he flew off into 
the night.
   The twinkling stars lit the Parrot Shah's path home. This time it was hard 
to cross the mountain, but the parrot felt neither cold nor fatigue, for he 
could still picture Gala's lovely face. As he gripped the magic pomegranate, 
the parrot knew that it was hindering his flight, and his wings grew weary and
slow. In panic, he felt he was going to drop the fruit, but the thought of 
Gala's eyes filled him with new strength. Suddenly he saw the valley. He was 
over the mountain. Now, he had to find the energy to go on and re-enter his 
own body. And then admire Gala, the bride of his dreams.
   Saleb had been watching at the window, left open day and night, and 
guarding his master's lifeless body. Full of remorse at having coaxed the Shah
into undertaking such a dangerous mission, the poor Minister had never stopped
praying. Suddenly, he leapt to his feet:
   "Thank Heavens!" he cried. "At last! At last! . . " The stars were fading 
and the sun coming up, tinting the clouds with pink, when the parrot appeared.
Gently laying its preclous burden on the bed, the bird went back to its 
perch... and the Shah's body came slowly to life. Saleb threw himself in 
front of his master.
   "Sire!" he gasped. "I've been so afraid. I thought I'd never see you 
again." The magic worked as the sun rose over the horizon and its first rays 
shone through the window. The pomegranate began to grow and grow as it did 
each morning, then it gently opened and out stepped Gala, smiling.
   "Where am I? How did I get here?" she gasped in surprise. The Shah clasped 
her hand and kissed it fleetingly.
   "You're in your future husband's palace!" The Chief Minister clapped his 
hands in delight. The wedding took place the very next day and the couple 
ruled happily ever after.
From that day, all the parrots in the Shah's kingdom were treated with great 
respect. A parrot was even included in the royal coat-of-arms and fluttered 
from the army's banners, while to all the people it was a sacred symbol.
   Once upon a time... a carpenter, picked up a strange lump of wood one day 
while mending a table. When he began to chip it, the wood started to moan. 
This frightened the carpenter and he decided to get rid of it at once, so he 
gave it to a friend called Geppetto, who wanted to make a puppet. Geppetto, a 
cobbler, took his lump of wood home, thinking about the name he would give his
puppet.
   "I'll call him Pinocchio," he told himself. "It's a lucky name." Back in 
his humble basement home and workshop, Geppetto started to carve the wood. 
Suddenly a voice squealed:
   "Ooh! That hurt!" Geppeto was astonished to find that the wood was alive. 
Excitedly he carved a head, hair and eyes, which immediately stared right at 
the cobbler. But the second Geppetto carved out the nose, it grew longer and 
longer, and no matter how often the cobbler cut it down to size, it just 
stayed a long nose. The newly cut mouth began to chuckle and when Geppetto 
angrily complained, the puppet stuck out his tongue at him. That was nothing, 
however! When the cobbler shaped the hands, they snatched the good man's wig, 
and the newly carved legs gave him a hearty kick. His eyes brimming with 
tears, Geppetto scolded the puppet.
   "You naughty boy! I haven't even finished making you, yet you've no respect
for your father!" Then he picked up the puppet and, a step at a time, taught 
him to walk. But the minute Pinocchio stood upright, he started to run about 
the room, with Geppetto after him, then he opened the door and dashed into the
street. Now, Pinocchio ran faster than Geppetto and though the poor cobbler 
shouted "Stop him! Stop him!" none of the onlookers, watching in amusement, 
moved a finger. Luckily, a policeman heard the cobbler's shouts and strode 
quickly down the street. Grabbing the runaway, he handed him over to his 
father.
   "I'll box your ears," gasped Geppetto, still out of breath. Then he 
realised that was impossible, for in his haste to carve the puppet, he had 
forgotten to make his ears. Pinocchio had got a fright at being in the 
clutches of the police, so he apologised and Geppetto forgave his son.
   Indeed, the minute they reached home, the cobbler made Pinocchio a suit 
out of flowered paper, a pair of bark shoes and a soft bread hat. The puppet 
hugged his father.
   "I'd like to go to school," he said, "to become clever and help you when 
you're old!" Geppetto was touched by this kind thought.
   "I'm very grateful," he replied, "but we haven't enough money even to buy 
you the first reading book!" Pinocchio looked downcast, then Geppetto 
suddenly rose to his feet, put on his old tweed coat and went out of the 
house. Not long after he returned carrying a first reader, but minus his 
coat. It was snowing outside.
   "Where's your coat, father?"
   "I sold it."
   "Why did you sell it?"
   "It kept me too warm!"
   Pinocchio threw his arms round Geppetto's neck and kissed the kindly old 
man.
   It had stopped snowing and Pinocchio set out for school with his first 
reading book under his arm. He was full of good intentions. "Today I want to 
learn to read. Tomorrow I'll learn to write and the day after to count. Then 
I'll earn some money and buy Geppetto a fine new coat. He deserves it, 
for . . ." The sudden sound of a brass band broke into the puppet's daydream
and he soon forgot all about school. He ended up in a crowded square where 
people were clustering round a brightly coloured booth.
   "What's that?" he asked a boy.
   "Can't you read? It's the Great Puppet Show!" 
   "How much do you pay to go inside?" 
   "Fourpence.' 
   "Who'll give me fourpence for this brand new book?" Pinocchio cried. A 
nearby junk seller bought the reading book and Pinocchio hurried into the 
booth. Poor Geppetto. His sacrifice had been quite in vain. Hardly had 
Pinocchio got inside, when he was seen by one of the puppets on the stage 
who cried out:
   "There's Pinocchio! There's Pinocchio!"
   "Come, along. Come up here with us. Hurrah for brother Pinocchio!" cried 
the puppets. Pinocchio weent onstage with his new friends, while the 
spectators below began to mutter about uproar. Then out strode Giovanni, the 
puppet-master, a frightful looking man with fierce bloodshot eyes.
   "What's going on here? Stop that noise! Get in line, or you'll hear about 
it later!"
   That evening, Giovanni sat down to his meal, but when he found that more 
wood was needed to finish cooking his nice chunk of meat, he remembered the 
intruder who had upset his show.
   "Come here, Pinocchio! You'll make good firewood!" The poor puppet started 
to weep and plead. 
   "Save me, father! I don't want to die . . . I don't want to die!" When 
Giovanni heard Pinocchio's cries, he was surprised.
   "Are your parents still alive?" he asked.
   "My father is, but I've never known my mother," said the puppet in a low 
voice. The big man's heart melted.
   "It would be beastly for your father if I did throw you into the fire . . .
but I must finish roasting the mutton. I'll just have to burn another puppet. 
Men! Bring me Harlequin, trussed!" When Pinocchio saw that another puppet was 
going to be burned in his place, he wept harder than ever.
   "Please don't, sir! Oh, sir, please don't! Don't burn Harlequin!"
   "That's enough!" boomed Giovanni in a rage. "I want my meat well cooked!"
   "In that case," cried Pinocchio defiantly, rising to his feet, "burn me! 
It's not right that Harlequin should be burnt instead of me!"
   Giovanni was taken aback. "Well, well!" he said. "I've never met a puppet 
hero before!" Then he went on in a milder tone. "You really are a good lad. I 
might indeed . . ." Hope flooded Pinocchio's heart as the puppet-master stared
at him, then at last the man said: "All right! I'll eat half-raw mutton 
tonight, but next time, somebody will find himself in a pickle." All the 
puppets were delighted at being saved. Giovanni asked Pinocchio to tell  him 
the whole tale, and feeling sorry for kindhearted Geppetto, he gave the puppet
five gold pieces.
   "Take these to your father," he said. "Tell him to buy himself a new coat, 
and give him my regards."
   Pinocchio cheerfully left the puppet booth after thanking Giovanni for 
being so generous. He was hurrying homewards when he met a half-blind cat and
a lame fox. He couldn't help but tell them all about his good fortune, and when
the pair set eyes on the gold coins, they hatched a plot, saying to Pinocchio:
   "If you would really like to please your father, you ought to take him a 
lot more coins. Now, we know of a magic meadow where you can sow these five 
coins. The next day, you will find they have become ten times as many!"
   "How can that happen?" asked Pinocchio in amazement.
   "I'll tell you how!" exclaimed the fox. "In the land of Owls lies a meadow 
known as Miracle Meadow. If you plant one gold coin in a little hole, next day
you will find a whole tree dripping with gold coins!" Pinocchio drank in every
word his two "friends" uttered and off they all went to the Red Shrimp Inn to 
drink to their meeting and future wealth.
   After food and a short rest, they made plans to leave at midnight for
Miracle Meadow. However, when Pinocchio was wakened by the innkeeper at the 
time arranged, he found that the fox and the cat had already left. All the 
puppet could do then was pay for the dinner, using one of his gold coins, and 
set off alone along the path through the woods to the magic meadow. 
Suddenly... "Your money or your life!" snarled two hooded bandits. Now, 
Pinocchio had hidden the coins under his tongue, so he could not say a word, 
and nothing the bandits could do would make Pinocchio tell where the coins 
were hidden. Still mute, even when the wicked pair tied a noose round the poor
puppet's neck and pulled it tighter and tighter, Pinocchio's last thought was 
"Father, help me!"
   Of course, the hooded bandits were the fox and the cat. "You'll hang 
there," they said, "till you decide to talk. We'll be back soon to see if you 
have changed your mind!" And away they went. 
   However, a fairy who lived nearby had overheard everything . . . From the 
castle window, the Turquoise Fairy saw a kicking puppet dangling from an oak 
tree in the wood. Taking pity on him, she clapped her hands three times and 
suddenly a hawk and a dog appeared.
   "Quickly!" said the fairy to the hawk. "Fly to that oak tree and with your 
beak snip away the rope round the poor lad's neck!"
   To the dog she said: "Fetch the carriage and gently bring him to me!"
   In no time at all, Pinocchio, looking quite dead, was lying in a cosy bed 
in the castle, while the fairy called three famous doctors, crow, owl and 
cricket. A very bitter medicine, prescribed by these three doctors quickly 
cured the puppet, then as she caressed him, the fairy said: "Tell me what 
happened!" 
   Pinocchio told her his story, leaving out the bit about selling his first 
reading book, but when the fairy asked him where the gold coins were, the 
puppet replied that he had lost them. In fact, they were hidden in one of his 
pockets. All at once, Pinocchio's nose began to stretch, while the fairy 
laughed.
   "You've just told a lie! I know you have, because your nose is growing 
longer!" Blushing with shame, Pinocchio had no idea what to do with such an 
ungainly nose and he began to weep. However, again feeling sorry for him, the 
fairy clapped her hands and a flock of woodpeckers appeared to peck his nose 
back to its proper length.
   "Now, don't tell any more lies," the fairy warned him," or your nose will 
grow again! Go home and take these coins to your father."
   Pinocchio gratefully hugged the fairy and ran off homewards. But near the 
oak tree in the forest, he bumped into the cat and the fox. Breaking his 
promise, he foolishly let himself be talked into burying the coins in the 
magic meadow. Full of hope, he returned next day, but the coins had gone. 
Pinocchio sadly trudged home without the coins Giovanni had given him for his
father.
   After scolding the puppet for his long absence, Geppetto forgave him and
off he went to school. Pinocchio seemed to have calmed down a bit. But someone
else was about to cross his path and lead him astray. This time, it was Carlo,
the lazy bones of the class. 
   "Why don't you come to Toyland with me?" he said. "Nobody ever studies 
there and you can play all day long!"
   "Does such a place really exist?" asked Pinocchio in amazement.
   "The wagon comes by this evening to take me there," said Carlo. "Would you 
like to come?"
   Forgetting all his promises to his father and the fairy, Pinocchio was 
again heading for trouble. Midnight struck, and the wagon arrived to pick up 
the two friends, along with some other lads who could hardly wait to reach a 
place where schoolbooks and teachers had never been heard of. Twelve pairs of 
donkeys pulled the wagon, and they were all shod with white leather boots. The
boys clambered into the wagon. Pinocchio, the most excited of them all, jumped
on to a donkey. Toyland, here we come!
   Now Toyland was just as Carlo had described it: the boys all had great fun 
and there were no lessons. You weren't even allowed to whisper the word 
"school", and Pinocchio could hardly believe he was able to play all the time.
   "This is the life!" he said each time he met Carlo.
   "I was right, wasn't I?" exclaimed his friend, pleased with himself.
   "Oh, yes Carlo! Thanks to you I'm enjoying myself. And just think: teacher 
told me to keep well away from you."
   One day, however, Pinocchio awoke to a nasty surprise. When he raised a 
hand to his head, he found he had sprouted a long pair of hairy ears, in place
of the sketchy ears that Geppetto had never got round to finishing. And that 
wasn't all! The next day, they had grown longer than ever. Pinocchio 
shamefully pulled on a large cotton cap and went off to search for Carlo. He 
too was wearing a hat, pulled right down to his nose. With the same thought in
their heads, the boys stared at each other, then snatching off their hats, 
they began to laugh at the funny sight of long hairy ears. But as they 
screamed with laughter, Carlo suddenly went pale and began to stagger. 
"Pinocchio, help! Help!" But Pinocchio himself was stumbling about and he 
burst into tears. For their faces were growing into the shape of a donkey's 
head and they felt themselves go down on all foursf. Pinocchio and Carlo were 
turning into a pair of donkeys. And when they tried to groan with fear, they 
brayed loudly instead. When the Toyland wagon driver heard the braying of his 
new donkeys, he rubbed his hands in glee.
   "There are two fine new donkeys to take to market. I'll get at least four 
gold pieces for them!" For such was the awful fate that awaited naughty little
boys that played truant from school to spend all their time playing games.
   Carlo was sold to a farmer, and a circus man bought Pinocchio to teach him 
to do tricks like his other performing animals. It was a hard life for a 
donkey! Nothing to eat but hay, and when that was gone, nothing but straw. And
the beatings! Pinocchio was beaten every day till he had mastered the 
difficult circus tricks. One day, as he was jumping through the hoop, he 
stumbled and went lame. The circus man called the stable boy.
   "A lame donkey is no use to me," he said. "Take it to market and get rid of
it at any price!" But nobody wanted to buy a useless donkey. Then along came a
little man who said: "I'll take it for the skin. It will make a good drum for 
the village band!"
   And so, for a few pennies, Pinocchio changed hands and he brayed 
sorrowfully when he heard what his awful fate was to be. The puppet's new 
owner led him to the edge of the sea, tied a large stone to his neck, and a 
long rope round Pinocchio's legs and pushed hlm into the water. Clutching the 
end of the rope, the man sat down to wait for Pinocchio to drown. Then he 
would flay off the donkey's skin.
   Pinocchio struggled for breath at the bottom of the sea, and in a flash, 
remembered all the bother he had given Geppetto, his broken promises too, and 
he called on the fairy.
   The fairy heard Pinocchio's call and when she saw he was about to drown, 
she sent a shoal of big fish. They ate away all the donkey flesh, leaving the 
wooden Pinocchio. Just then, as the fish stopped nibbling, Pinocchio felt 
himself hauled out of the water. And the man gaped in astonishment at the 
living puppet, twisting and turning like an eel, which appeared in place of 
the  dead donkey. When he recovered his wits, he babbled, almost in tears: 
"Where's the donkey I threw into the sea?"
   "I'm that donkey", giggled Pinocchio.
   "You!" gasped the man. "Don't try pulling my leg. If I get angry . . ."
   However, Pinocchio told the man the whole story . . . "and that's how you 
come to have a live puppet on the end of the rope instead of a dead donkey!"
   "I don't give a whit for your story," shouted the man in a rage. "All I 
know is that I paid twenty coins for you and I want my money back! Since 
there's no donkey, I'll take you to market and sell you as firewood!"
   By then free of the rope, Pinocchio made a face at the man and dived into 
the sea. Thankful to be a wooden puppet again, Pinocchio swam happily out to 
sea and was soon just a dot on the horizon. But his adventures were far from 
over. Out of the water behind him loomed a terrible giant shark! A horrified
Pinocchio sawits wide open jaws and tried to swim away as fast as he could, 
but the monster only glided closer. Then the puppet tried to escape by going 
in the other direction, but in vain. He could never escape the shark, for as 
the water rushed into its cavern-like mouth, he was sucked in with it. And in 
an instant Pinocchio had been swallowed along with shoals of fish unlucky 
enough to be in the fierce creature's path. Down he went, tossed in the 
torrent of water as it poured down the shark's throat, till he felt dizy. When
Pinocchio came to his senses, he was in darkness. Over his head, he could hear
the loud heave of the shark's gills. On his hands and knees, the puppet crept 
down what felt like a sloping path, crying as he went:
   "Help! Help! Won't anybody save me?"
   Suddenly, he noticed a pale light and, as he crept towards it, he saw it 
was a flame in the distance. On he went, till: "Father! It can't be you! . . ."
   "Pinocchio! Son! It really is you . . ."
   Weeping for joy, they hugged each other and, between sobs, told their 
adventures. Geppetto stroked the puppet's head and told him how he came to be 
in the shark's stomach.
   "I was looking for you everywhere. When I couldn't find you on dry land, I 
made a boat to search for you on the sea. But the boat capsized in a storm, 
then the shark gulped me down. Lucklly, it also swallowed bits of ships 
wrecked in the tempest, so I've managed to survive by gettlng what I could 
from these!"
   "Well, we're still alive!" remarked Pinocchio, when they had finished 
recounting their adventures. "We must get out of here!" Taking Geppetto's hand,
the pair started to climb up the shark's stomach, using a candle to light their
way. When they got as far as its jaws, they took fright, but as so happened,
this shark slept with its mouth open, for it suffered from asthma.
   As luck would have it, the shark had been basking in shallow waters since
the day before, and Pinocchio soon reached the beach. Dawn was just breaking,
and Geppetto, soaked to the skin, was half dead with cold and fright.
   "Lean on me, father." said Pinocchio. "I don't know where we are, but we'll
soon find our way home!"
   Beside the sands stood an old hut made of branches, and there they took 
shelter. Geppetto was running a temperature, but Pinocchio went out, saying, 
"I'm going to get you some milk." The bleating of goats led the puppet in the 
right direction, and he soon came upon a farmer. Of course, he had no money to
pay for the milk.
   "My donkey's dead," said the farmer. "If you work the treadmill from dawn 
to noon, then you can have some milk." And so, for days on end, Pinocchio rose
early each morning to earn Geppetto's food.
   At long last, Pinocchio and Geppetto reached home. The puppet worked late 
into the night weaving reed baskets to make money for his father and himself. 
One day, he heard that the fairy after a wave of bad luck, was ill in 
hospital. So instead of buying himself a new suit of clothes, Pinocchio sent 
the fairy the money to pay for her treatment.
   One night, in a wonderful dream, the fairy appeared to reward Pinocchio for
his kindness. When the puppet looked in the mirror next morning, he found he 
had turned into somebody else. For there in the mirror, was a handsome young 
lad with blue eyes and brown hair. Geppetto hugged him happily.
    "Where's the old wooden Pinocchio?" the young lad asked in astonishment.
"There!" exclaimed Geppetto, pointing at him. "When bad boys become good, 
their looks change along with their lives!"
   Once upon a time . . . a miller died leaving the mill to his eldest son, 
his donkey to his second son and . . . a cat to his youngest son.
   "Now that's some difference!" you might say; but there you are, that's how 
the miller was!
   The eldest son kept the mill, the second son took the donkey and set off in
search of his fortune . . . while the third sat down on a stone and sighed,
   "A cat! What am I going to do with that?" But the cat heard his words and 
said,
   "Don't worry, Master. What do you think? That I'm worth less than a 
half-ruined mill or a mangy donkey? Give me a cloak, a hat with a feather in 
it, a bag and a pair of boots, and you will see what I can do." The young man,
by no means surprised, for it was quite common for cats to talk in those days,
gave the cat what he asked for, and as he strode away, confident and cheerful.
the cat said. "Don't look so glum, Master. See you soon!"
   Swift of foot as he was, the cat caught a fat wild rabbit, popped it into 
his bag, knocked at the castle gate, went before the King and, removing his 
hat, with a sweeping bow, he said:
   "Sire, the famous Marquis of Carabas sends you this fine plump rabbit as a 
gift."
   "Oh," said the King, "thanks so much."
   "Till tomorrow," replied the cat as he went out. And the next day, back he 
came with some partridges tucked away in his bag. "Another gift from the brave
Marquis of Carabas," he announced. The Queen remarked,
   "This Marquis of Carabas is indeed a very courteous gentleman."
   In the days that followed, Puss in Boots regularly visited the castle, 
carrying rabbits, hares, partridges and skylarks, presenting them all to the 
King in the name of the Marquis of Carabas. Folk at the palace began to talk 
about this noble gentleman.
   "He must be a great hunter," someone remarked. "He must be very loyal to 
the King," said someone else. And yet another, "But who is he? I've never 
heard of him." At this someone who wanted to show people how much he knew, 
replied,
   "Oh, yes, I've heard his name before. In fact, I knew his father."
   The Queen was very interested in this generous man who sent these gifts. 
"Is your master young and handsome?" she asked the cat.
   "Oh yes. And very rich, too," answered Puss in Boots. "In fact, he would be
very honoured if you and the King called to see him in his castle." When the 
cat returned home and told his master that the King and Queen were going to 
visit him, he was horrified.
   "Whatever shall we do?" he cried. "As soon as they see me they will know 
how poor I am."
   "Leave everything to me," replied Puss in Boots. "I have a plan." For 
several days, the crafty cat kept on taking gifts to the King and Queen, and 
one day he discovered that they were taking the Princess on a carriage ride 
that very afternoon.
   The cat hurried home in great excitement. "Master, come along," he cried. 
"It is time to carry out my plan. You must go for a swim in the river."
   "But I can't swim," replied the young man.
   "That's all right," replied Puss in Boots. "Just trust me." So they went to
the river and when the King's carriage appeared the cat pushed his master into
the water.
   "Help!" cried the cat. "The Marquis of Carabas is drowning." The King heard
his cries and sent his escorts to the rescue. They arrived just in time to 
save the poor man, who really was drowning. The King, the Queen and the 
Princess fussed around and ordered new clothes to be brought for the Marquis 
of Carabas.
   "Wouldn't you like to marry such a handsome man?" the Queen asked her 
daughter.
   "Oh, yes," replied the Princess. However, the cat overheard one of the 
ministers remark that they must find out how rich he was.
   "He is very rich indeed," said Puss in Boots. "He owns the castle and all 
this land. Come and see for yourself. I will meet you at the castle." 
   And with these words, the cat rushed off in the direction of the castle, 
shouting at the peasants working in the fields, "If anyone asks you who your 
master is, answer: the Marquis of Carabas. Otherwise you will all be sorry." 
And so, when the King's carriage swept past, the peasants told the King that 
their master was the Marquis of Carabas.
   In the meantime, Puss in Boots had arrived at the castle, the home of a 
huge, cruel ogre. Before knocking at the gate, the cat said to himself, "I 
must be very careful, or I'll never get out of here alive." When the door 
opened, Puss in Boots removed his feather hat, exclaiming, "My Lord Ogre, my 
respects!"
   "What do you want, cat?" asked the ogre rudely.
   "Sire, I've heard you possess great powers. That, for instance, you can 
change into a lion or an elephant."
   "That's perfectly true," said the ogre, "and so what?"
   "Well," said the cat, "I was talking to certain friends of mine who said 
that you can't turn into a tiny little creature, like a mouse."
   "Oh, so that's what they say, is it?" exclaimed the ogre. The cat nodded,
   "Well, Sire, that's my opinion too, because folk that can do big things 
never can manage little ones."
   "Oh, yes? Well, just watch this!" retorted the ogre, turning into a mouse. 
In a flash, the cat leapt on the mouse and ate it whole. Then he dashed to the
castle gate, just in time, for the King's carriage was drawing up. With a bow,
Puss in Boots said,
   "Sire, welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!" The King and 
Queen, the Princess and the miller's son who, dressed in his princely clothes,
really did look like a marquis, got out of the carriage and the King spoke:
   "My dear Marquis, you're a fine, handsome, young man, you have a great deal
of land and a magnificent castle. Tell me, are you married?"
   "No," the young man answered, "but I would like to find a wife." He looked 
at the Princess as he spoke. She in turn smiled at him.
   To cut a long story short, the miller's son, now Marquis of Carabas, 
married the Princess and lived happily with her in the castle. And from time 
to time, the cat would wink and whisper, "You see, Master, I am worth a lot 
more than any mangy donkey or half-ruined mill, aren't I?"
    All of you are being faced with choices. Many of you are so 
        engrossed with your idea of reality you are not seeing beyond the 
        simplest Illusions around you. You are not alone as Solinus and I 
        see this even in areas very close to us in our family unit.
             But what is reality? Is it something we base life on that 
        may or may not be a correct situation but that we use as our 
        basic guidelines in living our lives. I think it is something 
        closer to our idea of what keeps us safe, secure and in a sense 
        of well being. It is in other words our security blanket - what 
        we believe makes our lives work. It is the way we choose to see 
        life versus what may or may not be life in a true reality.
             All of you have through the years heard about other systems, 
        less free countries where people are taught from a very early age 
        to accept a system of belief that gives little in return. Infor-
        mation is usually censored and keeps, for the most part, other 
        systems of living out of the direct knowledge of those who are 
        controled and indoctrinated into a group idea. These scenarios 
        are based on what a few in power wish as to the way things should 
        work. 
             My next question when comparing our society to one of cen-
        sorship is how is our system any better than any of these others? 
        Here is where many will stand up and say it's better than all the 
        rest in the world. It may be, but if it is it would not fluctuate 
        and create suffering in the group following the guidelines of  
        those few in power running this country. 
             Look at your present situation. Do you honestly believe it 
        is faltering because times are bad? Is it possible you have been 
        brainwashed as many, if not all peoples of other countries are? 
        And that you will refuse to see it until the people that are 
        controlling you decide to change things that directly effect the 
        security blanket you base life on.
             Reality dear ones is truth that in its context cannot be 
        changed. When it is altered in ways that create thoughts of well 
        being it still remains the same, the alteration becoming the 
        lived Illusion. Society that gains power by a fellowship based on 
        any altered truths creating a feeling of well being may give a 
        sense of security and well being until the real worth becomes 
        self evident. Then a change by those who are following the Illu-
        sion either crumbles or a new altered truth sets a foundation for 
        yet another crash of its real worth down the line. In reality the 
        real truth gets put aside for yet another created Illusion.
             Each time this happens it opens new awareness in a few which 
        undermines the real worth of being followers of those creating 
        this Illusion. The opportunity comes in these times to release a 
        few from the bigger group not seeing and willing to go on to yet 
        another false start creating yet another duration of pain and 
        suffering down the line. This is the cross roads all now face. 
        This is your chance to stand up as sovereign beings dependent on 
        yourself and your creator for your existence in these times of 
        upheaval. Many of you will cower and ask for the old to carry you 
        into their ideas and projections of the new. Some will say no 
        there now is another way and see, thus finding truth versus 
        getting sucked into another round of deceit by following someone 
        else in their projected idea of how the group will survive the 






        times ahead.
             The truth dear ones is that you are sovereign beings never 
        meant to follow anyone or thing but the God within. That is the 
        simplicity of truth versus the diversity burying it that you base 
        life on while living it on Earth. You're going to say just plac-
        ing myself in the unknown will not create what I need. You're 
        wrong and this type thinking will create your next experience of 
        pain and suffering.
             Some of you are now saying what in the heck is this guy 
        saying. I'm saying there is a link to God in you which many of 
        you fail to hear when it speaks to you because you're listening 
        to false gods telling you an altered aspect of this truth. This 
        statement is not based on any religious aspect or dogmatic ideal 
        but stands on its own worth because it is true. Follow this voice 
        and your whole life will change in the best or worst times to the 
        absolute reality of your reason for being created.  This will 
        give you freedom over the dominion you are in and all else here 
        controlling things around you and others that before you believed 
        effected you. 
             If your desire is to find truth in your life versus every-
        thing else you previously based life on, it is now time to listen 
        to that voice in you. All else is Illusion. Freedom is opening to 
        this truth and releasing the Illusion. All else of worth follows 
        by this simple act.
   Once there was a time, thousands of years ago, when animals were not the 
same as they are now. Except for a few like the lion, the tiger and the 
butterflies, they all looked alike. All were more or less the same height, 
everyone had four legs and it wasn't easy to tell which was which, even though
the elephant did weigh more than the hyena, and the hippo more than the 
gazelle. One day, while all the animals were relaxing in a field, along came a
red dragon, out of breath, crying,
   "We're in danger, folks! The world is about to come to an end!"
   "How do you know?" everyone asked. The dragon replied,
   "I read it in the stars. We must escape!"
   "But where can we go?" they asked him.
   "To another world," he replied. "I'll take you there. I can fly and I'll 
take you to a planet that is safer than this one." Frightened, as they were, 
all the animals climbed on to the dragon's back.
   With a bored look, the lion said, "I'm not scared of anything, so I'll just
stay here on Earth." The others, however, were fighting to get on the dragon's
back.
   "Don't push, you behind!" shouted the crocodile.
   "Hey, move that paw!" It was just like people today pushing and shoving to 
get onto an overcrowded train. At last the dragon cried,
   "Ready! Off we go," and started to run for takeoff. The first and the 
second runs weren't fast enough, but at the third try he finally got off the 
ground, flapping his wings and waving his tail.
   "Not so fast!" shouted somebody, and another voice yelled: "Faster, or we 
will end up in the trees!" The dragon replied,
   "Oh, bother! I'm doing the best I can. Why don't you lot keep still, for 
once." The fact was that because they were frightened, they did everything but
keep still, and so, after a while, the poor red dragon, now very tired, simply
could not flap his wings any longer . . . and crashed on a lovely green meadow.
   All the animals shrieked with terror. Nobody lost his life . . but the 
snake lost his legs and slithered away through the grass. The rhino bumped his
head and grew a horn. All the elephant's teeth fell out, except for two which 
became very long. The giraffe sprained his neck and it grew to a great length.
The hippo rolled about so much he became nearly round, ended up in a pond and 
didn't come out, he was too ashamed to be seen . . . Well, in that fall, all 
the animals took on a different appearance and became what they are today. And
when the lion saw them, what he said was:
   "Oh, how funny you look!"   By then free of the rope, Pinocchio made a face at the man and dived into 
the sea. Thankful to be a wooden puppet again, Pinocchio swam happily out to 
sea and was soon just a dot on the horizon. But his adventures were far from 
over. Out of the water behind him loomed a terrible giant shark! A horrified
Pinocchio sawits wide open jaws and tried to swim away as fast as he could,

   Suddenly, he noticed a pale light and, as he crept towards it, he saw it 
was a flame in the distance. On he went, till: "Father! It can't be you! . . ."
   "Pinocchio! Son! It really is you . . ."
   Weeping for joy, they hugged each other and, between sobs, told their 
adventures. Geppetto stroked the puppet's head and told him how he came to be 
in the shark's stomach.
   "I was looking for you everywhere. When I couldn't find you on dry land, I 
made a boat to search for you on the sea. But the boat capsized in a storm,

   In the meantime, Puss in Boots had arrived at the castle, the home of a 
huge, cruel ogre. Before knocking at the gate, the cat said to himself, "I 
must be very careful, or I'll never get out of here alive." When the door 
opened, Puss in Boots removed his feather hat, exclaiming, "My Lord Ogre, my 
respects!"
   "What do you want, cat?" asked the ogre rudely.
   "Sire, I've heard you possess great powers. That, for instance, you can 
change into a lion or an elephant."
   "That's perfectly true," said the ogre, "and so what?"
   "Well," said the cat, "I was talking to certain friends of mine who said 
that you can't turn into a tiny little creature, like a mouse."
   "Oh, so that's what they say, is it?" exclaimed the ogre. The cat nodded,
   "Well, Sire, that's my opinion too, because folk that can do big things 
never can manage little ones."
   "Oh, yes? Well, just watch this!" retorted the ogre, turning into a mouse. 
In a flash, the cat leapt on the mouse and ate it whole. Then he dashed to the
castle gate, just in time, for the King's carriage was drawing up. With a bow,
Puss in Boots said,
   "Sire, welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!" The King and 
Queen, the Princess and the miller's son who, dressed in his princely clothes,
really did look like a marquis, got out of the carriage and the King spoke:
   "My dear Marquis, you're a fine, handsome, young man, you have a great deal
of land and a magnificent castle. Tell me, are you married?"
   "No," the young man answered, "but I would like to find a wife." He looked 
at the Princess as he spoke. She in turn smiled at him.
   To cut a long story short, the miller's son, now Marquis of Carabas, 
married the Princess and lived happily with her in the castle. And from time 
to time, the cat would wink and whisper, "You see, Master, I am worth a lot 
more than any mangy donkey or half-ruined mill, aren't I?"
    All of you are being faced with choices. Many of you are so 
        engrossed with your idea of reality you are not seeing beyond the 
        simplest Illusions around you. You are not alone as Solinus and I 
        see this even in areas very close to us in our family unit.
             But what is reality? Is it something we base life on that 
        may or may not be a correct situation but that we use as our 
        basic guidelines in living our lives. I think it is something 
        closer to our idea of what keeps us safe, secure and in a sense 
        of well being. It is in other words our security blanket - what 
        we believe makes our lives work. It is the way we choose to see 
        life versus what may or may not be life in a true reality.
             All of you have through the years heard about other systems, 
        less free countries where people are taught from a very early age 
        to accept a system of belief that gives little in return. Infor-
        mation is usually censored and keeps, for the most part, other 
        systems of living out of the direct knowledge of those who are 
        controled and indoctrinated into a group idea. These scenarios 
        are based on what a few in power wish as to the way things should 
        work. 
             My next question when comparing our society to one of cen-
        sorship is how is our system any better than any of these others? 
        Here is where many will stand up and say it's better than all the 
        rest in the world. It may be, but if it is it would not fluctuate 
        and create suffering in the group following the guidelines of  
        those few in power running this country. 
             Look at your present situation. Do you honestly believe it 
        is faltering because times are bad? Is it possible you have been 
        brainwashed as many, if not all peoples of other countries are? 
        And that you will refuse to see it until the people that are 
        controlling you decide to change things that directly effect the 
        security blanket you base life on.
             Reality dear ones is truth that in its context cannot be 
        changed. When it is altered in ways that create thoughts of well 
        being it still remains the same, the alteration becoming the 
        lived Illusion. Society that gains power by a fellowship based on 
        any altered truths creating a feeling of well being may give a 
        sense of security and well being until the real worth becomes 
        self evident. Then a change by those who are following the Illu-
        sion either crumbles or a new altered truth sets a foundation for 
        yet another crash of its real worth down the line. In reality the 
        real truth gets put aside for yet another created Illusion.
             Each time this happens it opens new awareness in a few which 
        undermines the real worth of being followers of those creating 
        this Illusion. The opportunity comes in these times to release a 
        few from the bigger group not seeing and willing to go on to yet 
        another false start creating yet another duration of pain and 
        suffering down the line. This is the cross roads all now face. 
        This is your chance to stand up as sovereign beings dependent on 
        yourself and your creator for your existence in these times of 
        upheaval. Many of you will cower and ask for the old to carry you 
        into their ideas and projections of the new. Some will say no 
        there now is another way and see, thus finding truth versus 
        getting sucked into another round of deceit by following someone 
        else in their projected idea of how the group will survive the 






        times ahead.
             The truth dear ones is that you are sovereign beings never 
        meant to follow anyone or thing but the God within. That is the 
        simplicity of truth versus the diversity burying it that you base 
        life on while living it on Earth. You're going to say just plac-
        ing myself in the unknown will not create what I need. You're 
        wrong and this type thinking will create your next experience of 
        pain and suffering.
             Some of you are now saying what in the heck is this guy 
        saying. I'm saying there is a link to God in you which many of 
        you fail to hear when it speaks to you because you're listening 
        to false gods telling you an altered aspect of this truth. This 
        statement is not based on any religious aspect or dogmatic ideal 
        but stands on its own worth because it is true. Follow this voice 
        and your whole life will change in the best or worst times to the 
        absolute reality of your reason for being created.  This will 
        give you freedom over the dominion you are in and all else here 
        controlling things around you and others that before you believed 
        effected you. 
             If your desire is to find truth in your life versus every-
        thing else you previously based life on, it is now time to listen 
        to that voice in you. All else is Illusion. Freedom is opening to 
        this truth and releasing the Illusion. All else of worth follows 
        by this simple act.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home,

magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the

   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm

magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground.

magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the

   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse, scampering over a lion he had 
chanced upon, happened to wake him up. The angry lion grabbed the mouse and 
held it to his jaws. "Don't eat me, Your Majesty!" the mouse pleaded: "Forgive
me! If you let me go, I'll never bother you again. I'll always be grateful, 
and will do you a good turn one day." 
   The lion, who had no intention of eating such a little scrap, and only 
wanted to frighten the mouse, chuckled: "Well, well. A mouse that hopes to do 
a lion a good turn! By helping me to hunt, maybe? Or would you rather roar in 
my place?" The mouse was at a loss for words. "Sire, I really . . ." 
   "All right. You can go," said the lion, shortly, opening his paw. The mouse
scurried thankfully away. 
   Some days later, the lion fell into a trap and found he was caught fast in 
a stout net. Try as he might, he could not a  escape. And the more he 
struggled, the more he became entangled in the mesh, till even his paws were 
held fast. He could not move an inch: it was the end. His strength, claws and 
fearsome fangs gave him no help in freeing himself from the tangle. He was 
about to resign himself to a cruel fate when he heard a small voice: "Do you 
need help, Sire?"
   Exhausted by his struggles, his eyes wet with rage, the lion looked round. 
"Oh, it's you! I'm afraid there's little you can do for me . . ."
   But the mouse broke in: "I can gnaw the ropes. I have strong teeth and, 
though it will take me some time, I'll manage." So the little mouse quickly 
gnawed at the meshes and soon the lion tugged a paw free, then another, till 
he finally succeeded in working himself free of the net.
   "You see, Sire, said tne mouse, "I've cone you a good turn in exchange for 
the favour you did me in letting me go unharmed."
   "How right you are. Never before has a big animal like myself had to be so 
grateful to a little scrap like you!"
   Once upon a time . . . a brave soldier returned from the wars. In spite of
his courage, his pockets were empty and hls only possession was his sword. As
he walked through a forest, he met a witch, who said to him: "I say, good
soldier, would you like to earn a bag of money?"
   "Money? I'd do anything for money . . ."
   "Good!" went on the witch. "It won't be difficult, you'll see! All you have
to do is go down that hollow tree till you reach a cave. There, you'll find
three doorways. When you open the first door, you'll see a big dog with eyes
like saucers, guarding a large chest of copper coins. Behind the second door
lies a treasure of silver coins, guarded by a dog with eyes the size of mill
stones. When you open the third door, you'll come upon another dog, with eyes
the size of a castle tower, beside a treasure of gold. Now, if you lay this
old apron of mine before these dogs, they'll crouch on it and do you no harm.
You'll be able to carry away all the coins you want. What do think of that?"
   However, the soldier suspiciously asked: "What do you want in return?"
   "Just bring me back an old tinderbox my grandfather left down there, long
ago!"
   So the young soldier tied a rope round his waist and, not forgetting his
trusty sword, he lowered himself into the hollow tree. To his great surprise, 
he found the three doorways and the three dogs, just as the witch had said. 
Soon he was back, his pockets bulging with coins, but before he handed the
tinderbox to the old witch, he asked her: "What do you want it for?"
   The witch hurled herself at the soldier, screaming: "Give it to me! Give it
to me at once, or else . . .", as she tried to scratch him. When the witch
attacked him, the soldier exclaimed: "Aha! So this is the thanks I get! Now
I'll show you!"
   He undid the rope from around his waist and tied up the old woman. Then
away he went, whistling cheerfully.
   When he reached the town, he said to himself: "Now I can feast as much as I
 like - at last!"
   After years of scrimping on a miserable pay, with his sudden wealth, the
soldier felt like a prince. He bought a new pair of boots and he went to the
best tailor in the town. Some days later, he was clad in a fine new uniform
and people turned in the street to admire him. Lavish with his money, the 
soldier was surrounded by folk quick to tell him how to spend his coins, and
it all went on a round of dances, fine carriages, theatres and, most of all, 
on drinking sprees. Of course, his money soon ran out and when this happened, 
his "friends" vanished. When the innkeeper discovered that the soldier could
no longer pay his board, he rudely put him out. So the poor soldier ended up
in a garret and every day he had to draw in his belt a little more. All the
fun was over. 
   One evening, he realized he had never used the old witch's tinderbox. So he
rubbed it, and as it sparked, the dog with the eyes like saucers suddenly 
appeared. 
   "Tell me your wish, sir," it said.
   ". . . bring me heaps of money!" gasped the soldier in amazement. A second
later, the dog was back with a bag of coins. Every time he rubbed the
tinderbox, the dog brought him more money. Then when he rubbed it quickly
twice in succession, the dog with eyes like mill stones stood before him, 
carrying silver coins. And when the soldier rubbed the tinderbox three times
in a row, the third dog came carrying gold. Rich all over again, the soldier
chose the best hotel in the town and went back to leading the life of a fine
gentleman.
   The soldier was told that the King would not allow anyone to meet his
beatufil daughter, for he believed in a saying that the Princess's destiny was
to marry a slmple soldler. That evening, the soldier rubbed the tinderbox.
   "Bring me the Princess," was his new order. Immediately the dog returned
with the beautiful Princess, fast asleep. The soldier kissed her. Next
morning, the girl told her parents that she had had a dream. But the Queen, 
suspiciously ordered one of the ladies-in-waiting to guard her daughter day
and night. The dog was seen when it came next evening and the alarm raised. 
The king's guards followed the dog and the soldier was arrested at dawn.
   The King's revenge was terrible: the soldier was to be hanged!
   In a dark prison, the soldier calmly awaited his fate. When the day of
execution came, a mob crushed round the scaffold.
   The soldier asked if he could smoke his pipe, and placed it between his
lips, as he rubbed the tinderbox over and over again. In a flash, the three
dogs appeared with gaping jaws and bloodshot eyes. At the soldier's sharp
command, they leapt on the guards and the crowd cheered in delight.
   Awestruck at this magic feat, the King bowed his head and whispered to the
Queen. "The saying is true!" he said. A little while after, the young soldier
married the Princess and the tinderbox was rubbed and rubbed, but this time to
 invite the three dogs to the splendid wedding.
    Once upon a time . . . in Ancient Greece lived a young man called 
Narcissus, who was greatly admired, for he was very handsome. Narcissus was
very proud of his perfect face and graceful body, and never lost the chance to
look at hls reflection in any sheet of water he happened to pass. He would lie
for hours admiring his gleaming dark eyes, slender nose, slim hips and the mop
of curly hair that crowned the perfect oval of his face. You would think a
sculptor had come down from heaven to carve such a faultless body as a llvlng
image of mankind's love of beauty.
   One day, Narcissus was walking close to a precipice where the clear waters
of a cold mountain pool mirrored hls beautiful face.
   "You are handsome, Narcissus!" he told himself as he bent down to admire
his reflection. "There's nobody so handsome in the whole world! I'd love to 
kiss you."
   Narcissus was suddenly seized by the desire to kiss his own reflection and
he leant closer to the water. But he lost his balance and toppled into the
pool. Narcissus could not swim and so he drowned. But when the gods discovered
that the most beautiful being on earth had died, they decided that such beauty
could not be forgotten.
   The gods turned Narcissus into a scented flower which, to this day, 
blossoms in the mountains in spring, and which is still called Narcissus.
   Once upon a time, on the island of Kaledan, lived a king who was famous all
over the East, well-loved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies. 
In spite of having a good and beautiful wife, his life was not always happy. 
After years of marriage, they had no children and were afraid they would never
know the joy of a family.
   However, at long last, one splendid spring morning, a handsome baby boy was
born and his delighted parents called him Omar. In the language of Kaledan, 
this means "shining light". The years went by and Omar grew into a 
fine-looking youth, brave, intelligent and kind-hearted.
   On his eighteenth birthday, the king sent for his son.
   "Omar, now that you've come of age, you must find a wife. Choose one of the
many princesses you've met and whose only dream is of marrying you."
   "Father," said Omar respectfully, "I've no intention of getting married. 
I'm still young and I'd rather wait till the time is ripe. I want to think 
about it for at least another year." The king agreed and Omar spent the year 
studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom. And though he 
got to know a number of girls, he did not fall in love. When twelve months had
passed, the young prince was again summoned to his father.
   "Well, son," said the king anxiously, "when am I to announce your 
engagement?"
   "Alas, father, I still haven't met the right girl," was Omar's reply. The 
king lost his temper.
   "Omar! You must stop wasting time. You're a grown man now and I want to see
your heirs. Think of the future and make up your mind without delay."
   "I'm sorry, father, I can't do that just yet. I'm not in love and so I 
can't get married." The king, who could not bear to be crossed in such an 
important matter, went into a rage. He shouted for the guards and ordered them
to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest.
   In the meanwhile, lovely sweetnatured Princess Sheherazade was a maiden 
whose home was in China. When she became sixteen years old, her father 
insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her. But 
Sheherazade was waiting to meet a true love. And since nothing the king, her 
father, did served to change her mind, he locked the princess up in one of the
palaces.
   "I'd rather be a prisoner," said the princess, than have a husband I didn't
love."
   Meantime, Omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held 
prisoner. However, two invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi were amusing 
themselves, unknown to the prince, by secretly watching his movements. One day
Abhu said to his friend:
   "Omar is the most handsome person in the whole world."
   "Not so!" exclaimed Dhabi. "The most beautiful person in the world is 
Sheherazade, the King of China's daughter." The genies started to argue, then 
decided to ask Lilibeth, the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter. 
Lilibeth's advice was this:
   "Go to China, cast a sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to
Omar's castle. When you see them together, then you'll soon see which is the 
most beautiful." That very night Abhu and Dhabi flew all the way to China. The
two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to Omar's castle.
   "They're so lovely, they seem made for each other," remarked the genies, 
gazing at the two young people together. "If only they could get to know each 
other . . ." And in the hope that they might, the genies hid behind a curtain 
and waited . . .
   Not long afterwards, Sheherazade opened her eyes and, when she saw Omar at 
her side, her heart began to thump. This was the man she would like to marry. 
So she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as a token of
love. Then she went back to sleep. On wakening a little later, Omar set eyes 
on Sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty.
   "If this girl is as kind as she's beautiful, she would make a wonderful 
wife," said Omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement. Then he took off 
a ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess's finger. Drowsy again, he fell 
asleep. Abhu and Dhabi crept out from behind the curtain, wide-eyed.
   "They've fallen in love," said Dhabi. "What are we to do now?" 
   "Take Sheherazde home again. But if they have really fallen in love, 
they'll move heaven and earth to meet again."
   And so, when Omar awoke, Sheherazade had vanished. Confused and upset, the 
prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her. When the king heard
the story, he told Omar:
   "My lad, you are losing your head over a girl you dreamed about!"
   "No, she wasn't a dream," the prince insisted. "This is the ring she left 
me!" Omar was lovesick. The king called doctors and wise men, but there was 
nothing they could do, for Omar was losing his will to live.
   And far away, Sheherazade was pining in sorrow. The king was certain his 
daughter must have dreamt it all. How otherwise could she have met the 
mysterious young man? The only person who believed the princess was Marzuan, a
childhood friend, and he offered to search for the missing youth. Sheherazade 
handed him Omar's ruby ring. Marzuan set out that same day but, though he 
travelled far and wide, no-one could give him a clue as to the young man's 
identity.
   In the meantime, Abhu and Dhabi secretly followed in his tracks. One day, a
merchant told Marzuan that, on the island of Kaledan, there was a lovesick 
prince. Feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking, Marzuan 
took a passage on a ship bound for Kaledan. After days of sailing, a terrible 
storm broke, driving the ship onto a reef, where it sank. Clinging to a 
floating spar, Marzuan held on till the storm died away, then headed for the 
shore. The beach was deserted, but in the distance he could see the turrets of
a castle. Then, as he was getting his strength back, he saw a horseman 
approach.
   "Where am I?" Marzuan asked the stranger.
   "On the island of Kaledan," replied the horseman. "Who are you?" Marzuan 
jumped to his feet.
   "I'm a doctor, and famous in my own land. I hear that a prince here is 
seriously ill, and I'd like to try and cure him."
   "Yes," replied the horseman, "Prince Omar is indeed seriously ill, but it 
seems his illness is fatal." Disturbed by his words, Marzuan sald:
   "Take me to him straight away." When admitted to Omar's presence, without 
saying a word~ Marzuan showed him the ruby ring. Omar uttered a shriek and 
leapt to his feet. The onlookers stared in surprise.
   "This is the ring I gave to the girl I want to marry!" the prince exclaimed
joyfully.
   "That young lady is Sheherazade. She lives in far off China and is dying to
see you again," Marzuan told him instantly. Omar was delighted. In finding the
girl of his dreams, he would be truly happy.
   He presented Marzuan with a jewelled sword and a splendid horse, as fast as
the wind, as a token of thanks. Then he told him to take him as quickly as 
could be to the beautiful princess. Overcoming all the difficulties that it 
had to face during the long journey, the cheerful procession led by Omar and 
Marzuan, many days later, reached distant China. When they reached 
Sheherazade's city, Omar announced his arrival by sending a messenger with a 
letter for the princess and a diamond ring.
   At long last, the couple had met again. They exchanged their first, 
affectionate words and found they really were meant for each other. Sure of 
their feelings and anxious to start a new life together, Omar and Sheherazade 
quickly asked the king's permission to get married as soon as possible.
   The invisible genies, Abhu and Dhabi too, were at the wedding, a few days 
later.
   "Sheherazade really is lovely!" Dhabi exclaimed.
   "Yes, but Omar . . ." said Abhu.
   "Are you looking for an argument again?" demanded Dhabi. Just then, 
Lilibeth, the genie king's daughter appeared.
   "We still haven't decided which is the better-looking," said Abhu and Dhabi.
   "Well, I'd say they are the best-looking couple in the world," said 
Lilibeth. "And I'm certain their children will be even more handsome."
   And so the argument finally ended to everybody's satisfaction, and the two 
genies hugged each other contentedly.
   Once upon a time . . . hundreds of years ago, there lived a brave young 
Shah. His counsellor was a very old wise Minister called Saleb. 
   Like all his subjects, the Shah worshipped the God of Reason. Every day, he
went to the temple he had built close to the palace. In response to the 
prayers, the God gave the Shah good advice on the difficult art of government.
Indeed, the kingdom had never been so well ruled and had become very 
prosperous. One day, at the end of his first visit, the Shah was amazed to 
hear the God's deep voice say: "You no longer need my advice. You are wise 
enough. You can keep on praying to me, but this is the last time you will 
speak to me. But before I leave you to Fate, I will grant you a wish. Anything
you ask will be given to you."
   On his knees before the statue, the Shah thought for a long time before 
replying. Then he said: "Oh, God who rules over us all, thank you for all you 
have done for me and my people. Give me the power to transfer my soul into the
body of another man or animal, whenever I want. And let my own body remain 
intact till I enter it again."
   "It shall be so," said the God. "Now listen carefully . . ." Back at the 
palace, the Shah quickly called the Chief Minister.
   "Would you believe it, Saleb! In his infinite goodness, the God has given 
me his trust and a great power . . ." and he told his counsellor all about it.
The old man, however, had great doubts about the wisdom of this, but he hid 
his feelings.
   "This strange incredible thing could change my master's whole life and 
destiny," the old man told himself. "I must do my best to make sure he doesn't
alter his ways and makes no dangerous changes. What he needs is a wife and 
family to keep him from making risky decisions. It only takes strange deeds to
ruin good government.
   Once upon a time there lived a farmer who worked far from his home in the 
fields of a rich baron.
   In the past, gangs of bandits hid in the mountains rising behind the plain 
but the emperor had sent his soldiers to find and kill the thieves and now the
area was safe and quiet. Every once in a while, however, old weapons from past
battles could be found in the fields.
   While he was chopping a stump one day, the farmer found a bag full of gold.
The farmer had only ever seen silver coins in his life, and he was so 
astonished to find all that gold, that when he started walking home it was 
already dark. On his way home, the farmer thought about the problems that this
sudden wealth could cause him.
   First of all, everything found on the baron's territory belonged to the 
baron. By law, the farmer had to hand the gold over to the baron. The farmer 
decided that it was much more fair for him to keep the treasure because he was
very poor, rather than giving it to the baron who already had a lot of money. 
He realized the risk he would run if anyone found out about his luck. He would
never tell anyone, of course, but his wife had a reputation for talking too 
much and she would never keep a secret. Sooner or later he would end up in 
jail.
   He thought the problem over and over until he found a solution. Before 
getting home he left the bag full of gold in a bush next to some pine trees 
and the day after, instead of going to work, he went by the village to buy a 
few nice trout, some doughnuts and a rabbit. In the afternoon he went home and
said to his wife:
   "Get your wicker basket and come with me. Yesterday it rained  and the wood
is full of mushrooms. We must get to them before someone else does!" The wife,
who loved mushrooms, picked up her basket and followed her husband. When they 
got to the woods the farmer ran to his wife shouting: 
   "Look! Look! We have found a doughnut tree!" and he showed her the branches
he previously loaded with doughnuts. 
   The wife was astonished but she was even more puzzled when, instead of 
mushrooms, she found trout in the grass. The farmer laughed happily.
   "Today is our lucky day! My grandfather said that everyone has one lucky 
day. We might even find a treasure!" In addition to being a gossip, the
farmer's wife was also a sucker. So she believed her husband and repeated, 
while looking around: "This is our lucky day, this is our lucky day."
   The basket of the woman was full of fish by now. When she and her husband
reached the banks the farmer ran ahead of her, looked into the thicket and
said:
   "Yesterday I laid out my nets and I want to check whether I've caught any 
fish or shrimps." A few minutes later the wife heard the husband shout:
   "Run and see what I've caught! What extraordinary luck! I've fished a 
rabbit!" They were walking back home and the wife kept talking excitedly about
the great dinner with the doughnuts, the fish and the rabbit. The husband 
said: "Let's go by the wood again. We could find other doughnuts!"
   They went to the spot where the farmer had hidden his gold coins. The farmer
pretended to find something.
   "Look over here! There's a strange bag and... it's full of gold! This is an
enchanted forest. We found the doughnuts on the trees, then we found the trout
in the grass and now... gold." The poor woman was so excited that tears filled
her eyes. She could not utter another word and gulped as she touched the shiny
coins.
   At home, after dinner, neither of the two could fall asleep. The farmer and
his wife kept getting up to look over the treasure they had hidden in an old 
boot. The day after the farmer went back to work, but first said to his wife:
   "Don't tell anybody about what happened yesterday." And he repeated the 
same recommendation every day after that. Pretty soon, however, the entire 
village had heard about the treasure. The farmer and his wife were called by 
the baron and when they went in to see him the farmer tried to stand behind 
his wife. His wife, at the request of the baron, spoke first of the doughnuts,
then of the trout on the grass and lastly of the rabbit in the river. 
Meanwhile, behind her, the husband kept tapping his forehead with his finger 
and gesticulating to the baron. The baron began looking at the woman with pity.
   "And then I bet you found a treasure, too."
   "That's right, Sir!" the woman said. The baron turned to the farmer and, 
tapping his finger on his forehead sympathetically said:
   "I see what you mean. Unfortunately, I have the same problem with my 
wife . . ."
   The farmers were sent home and no one believed their story. And so the 
shrewd farmer didn't go to jail and spent his money wisely.
Once upon a time, a peasant worked hard to make a living from his land. 
Every year his pear tree produced four basketfuls of fruit which had to be 
given to the king, a greedy ruler who grew rich at the expense of the poor.
   One year, part of the pear harvest went bad and the peasant was able to 
pick only three and a half baskets of fruit. The poor man was beside himself 
with fear, for the king refused to take less than four basketfuls, and the 
peasant would be cruelly punished.
   All he could do was put his youngest daughter into one of the baskets and 
cover her with a layer of pears, so that the basket looked full. The king's 
servants took away the four baskets without ever noticing the trick, and the 
little girl found herself all alone in the pantry, under the pears.
   One day, the cook went into the pantry and discovered her. Nobody could 
understand where on earth she had come from, and not knowing what to do with 
her, it was decided she should become a maid in the castle. Folk called her 
Violetta, for her eyes reminded them of the colour of violets.
   Violetta was a pretty girl, sweet and generous. One day, as she was 
watering the flowers in the royal gardens, she met the king's son, a youth of 
her own age, and the two became friends. The other maids, jealous of 
Violetta's beauty and of the affection many people in the castle felt for the 
girl, did everything they could to get her into trouble, by spreading nasty 
rumours about her. One day, the king sent for her and said severely:
   "I'm told you boast of being able to steal the witches' treasure trove. Is 
that true?" Violetta said 'no,' but the king refused to believe her and drove 
her out of his kingdom.
   "You may return only when you have laid hands on the treasure," he said. 
All Violetta's fondest friends, including the prince, were sorry to hear of 
the king's decision, but could do nothing to stop her going. The girl wandered
through the forest and, when she came to a pear tree, she climbed into its 
branches and fell asleep. She was wakened at dawn by an old woman calling her:
   "What are you doing up there, all by yourself?" Violetta told the old woman
her tale. She offered to help the little girl, gave her some round loaves, a 
broom, a little oil and some good advice, and the girl again set off. She 
reached a clearing with a large wood stove and saw three women tearing their 
hair, using it to sweep the ashes from the stove. Violetta offered them the 
broom and the women pointed out the way to the witches' palace.
   Suddenly, two hungry mastiffs blocked her path. Violetta threw them the 
loaves, the dogs ate them and let her pass. Then she came to the bank of a 
river in flood, but remembering the old woman's advice, she sang:
   Clear sparkling river
   Let me cross over,
and the minute her song wafted into the air, the water stopped flowing. 
Violetta thus crossed the river and at last reached the witches' palace. The 
door was unlocked, but Violetta could not push it open for the hinges were
rusted. So she rubbed on a little oil and the door swung open. The little girl
walked through the empty halls till she came to a splendid room in wich lay a
magnificent coffer full of jewels. Holding the coffer under her arm, Violetta 
made for the door, but the coffer, being enchanted, cried out:
   "Door! Don't let her out!" However, the door did open, for Violetta had
oiled the hinges. Down at the river, the coffer cried out. This time it said:
   "Water! Drown her!" But the river did not stop the little girl from 
crossing; the two mastiffs did not attack ant the three strange women did not
burn her in their stove. For each, in its own way, repaid the girl's courtesy.
Back at the king's palace again, the prince ran happily to meet Violetta,
telling her:
   "When my father asks you what you want as a reward, ask him for the basket 
of pears in the pantry!" And this Violetta did. Pleased at paying such a 
modest price, the king instantly ordered the humble basket to be brought. But 
nobody ever imagined for a minute that underneath the pears lay the prince. 
The young man came out of his hiding place, swore he was in love with Violetta
and that he wanted to marry her.
   In this way, the king was forced to give his consent. Violetta brought her 
family to court and they all began a new and happy life.

I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . in the forest lived a wolf, known to be savage and 
ruthless. One day, feeling thirsty, the wolf went down to a stream, and as he 
drank the sparkling water, he saw a lamb drinking, further downstream. The 
minute he set eyes on the hapless lamb, he decided to make a meal of it. "A 
nice plump lamb! Fine and tender! Yummy! That will be deliclous! I haven't had
such luck in ages! Now, I must find an excuse for picking a quarrel, so that 
nobody can accuse me of gobbling it unjustly!"
   Unaware of the wolf, the lamb was still happily sipping the water when it 
heard a deep growl from above its head.
   "You down there! You're muddying my drinking water!"
   The lamb gasped in surprise: "I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I can t possibly be 
muddying your drinking water. I'm below you and the water is flowing downhill,
not up!"
   The wicked wolf was taken aback by this reply, but only for an instant. He 
quickly hit upon another excuse to be angry. "I hear you went around six 
months ago telling people that I'm violent and a bully!"
   At that, the now frightened lamb began to tremble, and it replied in a tiny
voice: "How can you believe such a thing, Mr. Wolf? I've never said a bad word
about you! Indeed, I'll be able only to speak well of you in the future." To 
its relief, the lamb remembered that it could prove its innocence. "I wasn't 
even born six months ago! So I couldn't have spread gosslp about you."
   But the wolf was only interested in gobbling up his prey, so he hastily 
broke in: "Well, if it wasn't you, it was your father," and, pouncing on the 
little white lamb, he quickly ate it.
   Alas and alack! Innocence does not always save us from the clutches of a
tyrant.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with

confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . in the forest lived a wolf, known to be savage and 
ruthless. One day, feeling thirsty, the wolf went down to a stream, and as he 
drank the sparkling water, he saw a lamb drinking, further downstream. The 
minute he set eyes on the hapless lamb, he decided to make a meal of it. "A 
nice plump lamb! Fine and tender! Yummy! That will be deliclous! I haven't had
such luck in ages! Now, I must find an excuse for picking a quarrel, so that 
nobody can accuse me of gobbling it unjustly!"
   Unaware of the wolf, the lamb was still happily sipping the water when it 
heard a deep growl from above its head.
   "You down there! You're muddying my drinking water!"
   The lamb gasped in surprise: "I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I can t possibly be 
muddying your drinking water. I'm below you and the water is flowing downhill,
not up!"
   The wicked wolf was taken aback by this reply, but only for an instant. He 
quickly hit upon another excuse to be angry. "I hear you went around six 
months ago telling people that I'm violent and a bully!"
   At that, the now frightened lamb began to tremble, and it replied in a tiny
voice: "How can you believe such a thing, Mr. Wolf? I've never said a bad word
about you! Indeed, I'll be able only to speak well of you in the future." To 
its relief, the lamb remembered that it could prove its innocence. "I wasn't 
even born six months ago! So I couldn't have spread gosslp about you."
   But the wolf was only interested in gobbling up his prey, so he hastily 
broke in: "Well, if it wasn't you, it was your father," and, pouncing on the 
little white lamb, he quickly ate it.
   Alas and alack! Innocence does not always save us from the clutches of a
tyrant.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,

  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but

few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . in the forest lived a wolf, known to be savage and 
ruthless. One day, feeling thirsty, the wolf went down to a stream, and as he 
drank the sparkling water, he saw a lamb drinking, further downstream. The 
minute he set eyes on the hapless lamb, he decided to make a meal of it. "A 
nice plump lamb! Fine and tender! Yummy! That will be deliclous! I haven't had
such luck in ages! Now, I must find an excuse for picking a quarrel, so that 
nobody can accuse me of gobbling it unjustly!"
   Unaware of the wolf, the lamb was still happily sipping the water when it 
heard a deep growl from above its head.
   "You down there! You're muddying my drinking water!"
   The lamb gasped in surprise: "I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I can t possibly be 
muddying your drinking water. I'm below you and the water is flowing downhill,
not up!"
   The wicked wolf was taken aback by this reply, but only for an instant. He 
quickly hit upon another excuse to be angry. "I hear you went around six 
months ago telling people that I'm violent and a bully!"
   At that, the now frightened lamb began to tremble, and it replied in a tiny
voice: "How can you believe such a thing, Mr. Wolf? I've never said a bad word
about you! Indeed, I'll be able only to speak well of you in the future." To 
its relief, the lamb remembered that it could prove its innocence. "I wasn't 
even born six months ago! So I couldn't have spread gosslp about you."
   But the wolf was only interested in gobbling up his prey, so he hastily 
broke in: "Well, if it wasn't you, it was your father," and, pouncing on the 
little white lamb, he quickly ate it.
   Alas and alack! Innocence does not always save us from the clutches of a
tyrant.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.      
   Once upon a time . . . a greedy emperor forced his subjects to pay heavy 
taxes. Not only the poor were squeezed, but the nobles in this immense empire 
were highly taxed too. At last, tired of being crushed by taxes, the nobles 
held a protest meeting. When the emperor heard about this, he took fright for 
he feared a rebellion. So he sent out this proclamation to put an end to their
complaints:
   "The nobleman that can make my daughter Sarah smile again, for she's 
mourning the loss of her fiance. will never pay taxes again."
   This caused an uproar at the protest meeting. Most of the princes decided 
there was no need now to complain, for each was quite sure he would succeed 
where others might fail. So off they went to get ready to try and make Sarah 
smile. But some of the nobles warned their fellows that, with his words, the 
emperor was not really abolishing any taxes at all. From that day on, a long 
procession of noble knights trooped from all over the empire to the palace to 
try and console the weeping princess.
   The crowds cheered them as they passed, but when they returned with bowed 
heads, the same crowds booed and whistled at their failure. The days went by 
and the list of defeated knights grew longer . . . Indians, Circassians, Arabs
and Turks . . . from all over the provinces came bold young men, bouncing with
confidence and hope. But the minute the princess set eyes on them, she just 
wept and wept. The emperor was delighted, for each failure meant another 
taxpayer. Even the common folk seemed contented to see that the rich too did 
not always get what they wanted. The only unhappy person among them was Sarah,
who went on weeping.
   One day, a Mongol prince seemed to be on the point of winning a smile. He 
thrummed his balalaika for hours, playing first a sad tune, then a more 
cheerful one, till he finished by playing a merry jig. The princess sat for 
ages staring at him eyed and the onlookers thought she was about to smile.
Instead she burst into floods of tears, to everyone's disappointment. A 
Kurdish chief, famed for his humour, who had already kept the court in fits of
laughter, tried to steal a smile from Sarah with his witty remarks. But the 
princess's dark eyes filled with tears. Noblemen came from as far away as 
Persia, but in vain.
   The only person who had not yet appeared was Omar, the chief of the tiniest
farthest away province. A bright, intelligent young man, he had cleverly got 
the better of certain greedy ambitious relatives that tried to take away his 
power when he succeeded his uncle as chief. The emperor's messengers had taken
a long time to reach this remote realm, and though Omar set out at once, on 
hearing the news, he rode for many days on his fine black horse. Then, one 
evening, he reached the palace. When the tired and dusty traveller explained 
to the stable boys why he had come, they laughed in scorn. But they had orders
to obey, so they told him to enter.
   "It's late," they said, "and you won't see the princess till tomorrow."
   The emperor's other daughters, however, were soon told of the new arrival.
"He's the most handsome of them all!" exclaimed one of the servants. So 
Marika, the emperor's youngest and prettiest daughter, with her sisters, 
peeked through a window at the sleeping Omar. Next morning, the emperor 
ordered the newcomer to be led before Sarah. The court crowded round to watch.
Unlike all the other suitors, Omar did nothing at all to amuse the princess. 
He stared at Sarah without saying a word. And she stared back, with an empty 
look on her face. The two young people stared silently at each other. Then 
Omar went back to the emperor and said:
   "Sire! Give me your sceptre and I will solve the problem of Sarah." 
Surprised at such an odd request, the emperor followed Omar into Sarah's room.
The other princesses clustered round, smiling and admiring the handsome young 
man. With a deep bow to Sarah, Omar straightened up and dealt her a blow on 
the head with the sceptre. Screams filled the air the emperor threw up hls
arms in rage and his daughters fled in all directions. The guards drew their 
swords. Then the whole room stopped in amazement. For, out of Sarah's head, 
which had been chopped off by the blow, rolled broken springs and pieces of 
metal. The princess that never smiled was a doll! A perfect dolll And nobody
had ever been aware of it except Omar.
   The only princess that couldn't stop laughing was Marika. The emperor 
glared at her.
   "Be quiet . . ." he ordered. But he too saw the funny side of it. For the 
crafty emperor had been making use of Sarah the doll as a way of guaranteeing 
himself a steady flow of taxes from all his subjects. And now, a man more 
cunning than himself had exposed his trick. The emperor had a sudden thought:
he would rid himself of the cheeky Marika and gain an astute son-in-law able 
to help him hold onto his kingdom.
   "You should be put to death for this insolence," he said, "but I'm going to
spare your life, if you marry my youngest daughter. Of course, you won't need 
to pay taxes!" Smiling at a happy Marika, Omar nodded silently. Down in the 
depths of his mind he was thinking:
   "One day, dear father-in-law, I'll be sitting on your Imperial throne." And
he was, a few years later.                                         
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home,

magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . in the forest lived a wolf, known to be savage and 
ruthless. One day, feeling thirsty, the wolf went down to a stream, and as he 
drank the sparkling water, he saw a lamb drinking, further downstream. The 
minute he set eyes on the hapless lamb, he decided to make a meal of it. "A 
nice plump lamb! Fine and tender! Yummy! That will be deliclous! I haven't had
such luck in ages! Now, I must find an excuse for picking a quarrel, so that 
nobody can accuse me of gobbling it unjustly!"
   Unaware of the wolf, the lamb was still happily sipping the water when it 
heard a deep growl from above its head.
   "You down there! You're muddying my drinking water!"
   The lamb gasped in surprise: "I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I can t possibly be 
muddying your drinking water. I'm below you and the water is flowing downhill,
not up!"
   The wicked wolf was taken aback by this reply, but only for an instant. He 
quickly hit upon another excuse to be angry. "I hear you went around six 
months ago telling people that I'm violent and a bully!"
   At that, the now frightened lamb began to tremble, and it replied in a tiny
voice: "How can you believe such a thing, Mr. Wolf? I've never said a bad word
about you! Indeed, I'll be able only to speak well of you in the future." To 
its relief, the lamb remembered that it could prove its innocence. "I wasn't 
even born six months ago! So I couldn't have spread gosslp about you."
   But the wolf was only interested in gobbling up his prey, so he hastily 
broke in: "Well, if it wasn't you, it was your father," and, pouncing on the 
little white lamb, he quickly ate it.
   Alas and alack! Innocence does not always save us from the clutches of a
tyrant.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with

so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came        
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
return, as I suppose you would not wish her to see it. You make it
a rule, I know, not to discuss theology with women, and I am much
of your opinion. When Ellen was a girl I carefully attended to the
culture of her mind, and encouraged her to read works of philosophy
and science. But, though I saw that she possessed a vigorous
intellect, I did not dare to carry her beyond the limits of Theism.
I feared that for her my faith would be but a system of cold and
comfortless philosophy, and that if at some future time, in
adversity or suffering, a religion became necessary to her, she
would run no slight risk of falling into Superstition. I saved her
from that danger by teaching her to believe in a God, compared with
whom the God of the Bible is a very indifferent character. But I
need not say that my God, though a nobler conception, is just as
much a creature of fiction as the other. They are both made by
human heads, as idols are made by human hands; only, while the
people of the churches and the chapels worship an idol of brass, I
gave my daughter an idol of gold. I formed her a God of the purest
and noblest ideas, and she still believes it to be real. Of course,
some day or other she may discover the deception; and were she to
read the enclosed manuscript, she would, I think, cease to believe
in the Divine benevolence, and next would begin to suspect that the
Being called God is as much a fabulous creature as Jupiter, Mars,
or Apollo. And then comes the great question   

Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . in the forest lived a wolf, known to be savage and 
ruthless. One day, feeling thirsty, the wolf went down to a stream, and as he 
drank the sparkling water, he saw a lamb drinking, further downstream. The 
minute he set eyes on the hapless lamb, he decided to make a meal of it. "A 
nice plump lamb! Fine and tender! Yummy! That will be deliclous! I haven't had
such luck in ages! Now, I must find an excuse for picking a quarrel, so that 
nobody can accuse me of gobbling it unjustly!"
   Unaware of the wolf, the lamb was still happily sipping the water when it 
heard a deep growl from above its head.
   "You down there! You're muddying my drinking water!"
   The lamb gasped in surprise: "I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I can t possibly be 
muddying your drinking water. I'm below you and the water is flowing downhill,
not up!"
   The wicked wolf was taken aback by this reply, but only for an instant. He 
quickly hit upon another excuse to be angry. "I hear you went around six 
months ago telling people that I'm violent and a bully!"
   At that, the now frightened lamb began to tremble, and it replied in a tiny
voice: "How can you believe such a thing, Mr. Wolf? I've never said a bad word
about you! Indeed, I'll be able only to speak well of you in the future." To 
its relief, the lamb remembered that it could prove its innocence. "I wasn't 
even born six months ago! So I couldn't have spread gosslp about you."
   But the wolf was only interested in gobbling up his prey, so he hastily 
broke in: "Well, if it wasn't you, it was your father," and, pouncing on the 
little white lamb, he quickly ate it.
   Alas and alack! Innocence does not always save us from the clutches of a
tyrant.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither. 
   Once upon a time . . . a restless crow decided to go farther away than 
usual from home and friends. Suddenly, in a farmyard, he met a pair of 
peacocks. What wonderful birds they were! The crow had never seen such 
beautiful feathers, and he timidly asked the regal-looking birds what they 
were.
   "We're peacocks," one of them replied, spreading its tail. And as the 
peacock strutted about, showing the crow his magnificent feathers, he 
screamed, as peacocks do. Bursting with admiration, the crow said goodbye and 
flapped away, but as he flew home, he could not forget the two peacocks. "What
fine feathers! They must be so happy, being so beautiful." And he gazed down 
sadly at his own ugly plumes. From that day on, he could not help thinking 
about the spiendour of the peacocks and his own plain feathers. He even 
stopped looking at himself in the pond water, for every time he did so, it 
made him even more depressed. He got into the habit of spying on the peacocks,
and the more he watched them strut royally around, the more envious he was of 
their beauty.
   One day, he noticed that one of the peacocks had dropped a feather. When 
the sun went down, the crow picked it up and hid it away. For days on end, he 
watched the peacocks and found another feather. When he had four, he could 
wait no longer: he stuck the peacock feathers onto his own tail, using pine 
resin, and started to parade up and down for his friends to admire.
   "Just look at my gorgeous tail!" he said proudly.
   "I'm not ugly like you! Out of my way, you moth eaten crows!" The crows' 
amazement soon changed to indignation, then they started to laugh and jeer at 
their vain companion. "You're nothing but a crow yourself, even with those 
flashy feathers!" they jeered.
   "And you're silly as well as ugly," replied the conceited crow haughtily, 
and off he went to live with the peacocks. When the peacocks set eyes on the 
stranger, they thought the crow was just another peacock who, for some reason,
had lost most of his feathers, and they felt sorry for him. But the crow, 
vainer than ever, wanted to attract greater admiration and a foolish idea came
into his head. He tried to scream the way the peacocks do when they fan their
tails. But the harsh "Craw! Craw! Craw!" quickly betrayed the crow. The 
furious peacocks pecked the stolen feathers off and chased the crow away. Poor
crow! For when, sad and downcast, he went back to his frlends, he was given 
exactly the same rough treatment. Nobody would speak to him and all the crows 
turned their backs on him for trying to be what he was not.
   Once upon a time . . . there lived a child who had a lot of toys. The child
kept his toys in his room and spent many happy hours everyday playing with 
them. One of his favourite games was the battle with the tin soldiers. He 
arranged the little toy soldiers in their respective ranks and fought 
imaginary battles.
   When the boy received the soldiers, as a present, he noticed that one of 
them had been made, by mistake, with just one leg. Despite the missing limb, 
the boy placed the little mutilated soldier in the front lines, encouraging 
him to be the most valorous of all the little soldiers. The child did not know
that, at night, the toys became animated and talked between themselves.
   It often happened that, when lining up the soldiers after playing with 
them, the little boy would forget about the little tin soldier without a leg 
and left him with all the other toys. It was thus that the little metal 
soldier got to talk to a pretty tin ballerina.
   A great friendship was born between the two, and pretty soon the little 
soldier fell in love with the ballerina. But the nights went by quickly, and 
he did not find the courage to declare his love to her. When the child played 
with the soldiers and positioned him in the front lines, the little soldier 
hoped that the ballerina would notice his courage in battle. And in the 
evening, when the ballerina asked the soldier if he had been afraid, he 
proudly answered, "No." 
   But the loving stares and sighs of the little soldier did not go unnoticed 
by the jack-in-the-box. One night, the jackin-the-box said to the little 
soldier: "Hey you! Don't look at the ballerina like that!" The poor little 
soldier was confused and he blushed, but the kind ballerina cheered him up.
   "Don't listen to him, he is ugly and jealous. I am very happy to talk to 
you," she said blushing too. The two little tin flgurines were both too shy to
speak of their love.
   One day they were separated. The boy picked up the tin soldier and placed 
him on the window-sill. 
   "You stay here and watch for the enemy," he said. Then the boy played 
inside with the other soliders.
   It was summer and in the days that followed the soldier remained on the 
window-sill. But one afternoon there was a sudden storm and a strong wind 
shook the windows. The Iittle soldier fell head first off the window-sill. His
bayonet stuck into the ground. It kept raining and storming and pretty soon 
the rain formed big puddles and the gutters were full. A group of boys in the 
nearby school waited for the storm to end and when it stopped raining hard 
they ran outdoors. 
   Joking and laughing, the boys hopped over the bigger puddles while two of 
them cautiously walked next to the wall so that the sprinkling rain wouldn't 
wet them. These two boys noticed the little tin soldier stuck in the sodden 
earth.
   "Too bad he has just one leg. Otherwise, I'd take him home with me," one of
the boys said. The other boy picked him up and put him in his pocket.
   "Let's take him anyway," he said. "We could use him for something." On the 
other side of the street, the gutter was overflowing and the current carried a
little paper boat.
   "Let's put the little soldier in the boat and make him a sailor," said the 
boy who had picked up the tin soldier.And so the little soldier became a 
sailor.
   The whirling gutter flowed into a sewer and the little boat was carried 
down the drain. The water in the underground sewage was deep and muddy. Big 
rats gnashed their teeth as the vessel and its unusual passenger flowed by. 
The boat was soaked and about to sink. But the little soldier, who had faced 
far greater dangers in battle, was not afraid. The water of the sewer then 
flowed into the river and the little boat, now overturned, was swept by the 
high waves. The little tin soldier realized his end was near. After the paper 
boat was wrecked, he sank in deep waters. A thousand thoughts went through the
little soldier's mind, but one in particular anguished him:
   "I will never see my sweet little ballerina again!" But a huge mouth 
swallowed the little tin soldier and, once again, his destiny took an 
unexpected turn.
   The little soldier found himself in the stomach of a large fish who had 
been lured by the glittering colours of his uniform. The fish, however, did 
not even have time to digest his meal because, shortly after having swallowed 
the soldier, he was caught in the net of a fisherman. Shortly after, the 
gasping fish ended up in a big basket and was brought to the market.
   Meanwhile, a cook was on her way to the market. She worked in the very same
house where the little soldier used to live.
   "This fish will be perfect for tonight's guests," the cook said when she 
saw the big fish on the fish market's counter. The fish ended up in the 
kitchen and when the cook slit its belly to clean it she found the little tin 
soldier.
   "This looks like one of our boy's toy soldiers . . ." she thought, and ran 
to the boy to show him her discovery.
   "That's right, it's my soldier!" the little boy cheered, when he recognized
the soldier with the missing leg.
   "I wonder how he got into the fish's belly? Poor soldier, he must have gone
through a lot of trouble since he fell off the window-sill!" The little boy 
placed the soldier on the mantle, right next to his sister's ballerina.
   The amazing ways of destiny had once again reunited the two lovers. The 
little soldier and the ballerina were very happy to be close to each other. At
night they talked about what had happened after their separation. But the ill 
disposition of fate had another surprise in store for them.
   One day a sudden gust of wind lifted the heavy drape of the window and hit 
the ballerina, who fell into the flreplace. The little soldier saw his friend 
fall into the fireplace and he was frightened. He knew a fire was lit because 
he could feel its warmth. He was desperate, conscious of not being able to do 
anything to save the ballerina. In fact, fire is the greatest enemy of tin 
figurines because it melts metals. Rocking back and forth on his one leg, the
little soldier tried to move the metal base under his feet that held him in
place.
   He kept trying to move until he fell into the fire as well. The two 
figurines were reunited in their misfortune. They were so close to each other 
now, that their metal bases began melting together. The tin of one base melted
with the metal of the other, and the metal strangely moulded into the shape of
a heart. As their bodies were about to begin melting as well, the little boy 
went by the fireplace and saw the two little figurines enveloped by the flames
and moved them away from the blaze with his foot.
   Ever since then the soldier and the ballerina have been melted close to 
each other, sharing their destiny and a common base shaped like a heart.
  Once upon a time . . . an old porcupine lived in a large wood with his twin
sons. Apples were their favourite dish, but the youngsters sometimes raided a 
neighbouring vegetable plot for the turnips Dad loved to munch. One day, one 
of the young porcupines set off as usual to fetch the turnips. Like all 
porcupines, he was a slow walker, and he had just reached a large cabbage, 
when from behind the leaves, out popped a hare.
   "So you have arrived at last!" said the hare. "I've been watching you for 
half an hour. Do you always dawdle? I hope you're quicker at eating, or it 
will take you a year to finish the turnips!" Instead of going into a huff at 
being teased, the porcupine decided to get his own back by being very crafty.
   Slow on his feet but a quick thinker, he rapidly hit on a plan. So the hare
sneered at the slow porcupine, did he? Well, the hare's own turn of speed would
be his downfall!
   "I can run faster than you if I try," said the porcuplne "Ha! Ha!" the hare
shrieked with laughter, raising a large paw. "You can't compete with this! My
grandad was the speediest hare of his day. He even won a gold penny. He used 
to be my coach. And you tell me you can run faster than me? Well, I bet my 
grandad's gold penny that I can win without even trying!"
   The porcupine paid little heed to the hare's boastful words and quietly 
acccepted the challenge. "I'll meet you tomorrow down at the ploughed field. 
We'll race in parallel furrows. And see wins!"
   The hare went away laughing.
   "Better stay here all night! You'll never get home and back in time for the
race!" he told the porcupine. The porcupine, however, had a bright idea. When
he arrived home, he told his twin brother what had happened. Just before dawn
next day, he gave his instructions, and off they set for the field. Hare 
appeared, rudely remarking: "I'll take off my jacket so I can run faster!"
   Ready! Steady! Go! And in a flash, the hare streaked to the other end of 
the field. There, waiting for him was a porcupine, which tesingly said:
   "Rather late, aren't you? I've been here for ages!" Gasping and so 
breathless his throat was dry, the hare whispered: "Let's try again!"
   "All right," agreed the porcupine, "we'll run the race again." Never in all
his life had the hare run so fast. Not even with the hounds snapping at his 
heels. But every time he reached the other end of the ploughed field, what did
he flnd but the porcupine, who laughingly  exclaimed: "What? Late again? I 
keep  on getting here first!" Racing up and down the field the hare sped, 
trying to beat the porcupine. His legs grew terribly tired and he began to 
sag. And every time he came to the end of the field there stood a porcupine
calling himself the winner.
   "Perhaps I ought to mention, friend hare, that my grandad was the fastest
porcupine of his day. He didn't win a gold penny, but he won apples, and after
the race, he ate them. But I don't want apples. I'd rather have the nice gold 
penny you promised me!" said one of the porcupine twins.
   The hare slid to the ground, dead tired. His head was spinning and his legs
felt like rubber.
   "This race is the end of me! I shall die here in this field, where I really
believed I was a sprinter! The shame of it! What a disgrace!" The hare 
staggered home, hot and sticky, to fetch the gold penny that he had never for 
a moment ever imagined he would lose. His eyes brimming with tears, he handed 
it over to the porcupines. 
   "Thank goodness my grandad isn't alive to see this!" he said. "Whatever 
would he say? After all his coaching, here I am, beaten by a porcupine!"
   That evening, a party was held at the porcupines' house. The twins danced 
triumphantly in turn, waving aloft the gold penny. Father Porcupine brought 
out his old accordion for the special occasion, and the fun went on all night.
 As luck would have it, the hare never did find out the secret of how the race
had been rigged. Which was just as well! . . .
Once upon a time . . . a llttle glrl tried to make a living by selling 
matches in the street.
   It was New Year's Eve and the snowclad streets were deserted. From brightly
lit windows came the tinkle of laughter and the sound of singing. People were
getting ready to bring in the New Year. But the poor little matchseller sat
sadly beside the fountain. Her ragged dress and worn shawl did not keep out
the cold and she tried to keep her bare feet from touching the frozen ground. 
She hadn't sold one box of matches all day and she was frightened to go home, 
for her father would certainly be angry. It wouldn't be much warmer anyway, in
the draughty attic that was her home. The little girl's fingers were stiff
with cold. If only she could light a match! But what would her father say at
such a waste! Falteringly she took out a match and lit it. What a nice warm
flame! The little matchseller cupped her hand over it, and as she did so, she
magically saw in its light a big brightly burning stove.
   She held out her hands to the heat, but just then the match went out and
the vision faded. The night seemed blacker than before and it was getting
colder. A shiver ran through the little girl's thin body. 
   After hesitating for a long time, she struck another match on the wall, and
this time, the glimmer turned the wall into a great sheet of crystal. Beyond
that stood a fine table laden with food and lit by a candlestick. Holding out
her arms towards the plates, the little matchseller seemed to pass through the
glass, but then the match went out and the magic faded. Poor thing: in just a
few seconds she had caught a glimpse of everything that life had denied her: 
warmth and good things to eat. Her eyes filled with tears and she lifted her
gaze to the lit windows, praying that she too might know a little of such
happiness.
   She lit the third match and an even more wonderful thing happened. There
stood a Christmas tree hung with hundreds of candles, glittering with tinsel
and coloured balls. "Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed the little matchseller, 
holding up the match. Then, the match burned her finger and flickered out. The
light from the Christmas candles rose higher and higher, then one of the
lights fell, leaving a trail behind it. "Someone is dying," murmured the
little girl, as she remembered her beloved Granny who used to say: "When a
star falls, a heart stops beating!"
   Scarcely aware of what she was doing, the little matchseller lit another
match. This time, she saw her grandmother.
   "Granny, stay with me!" she pleaded, as she lit one match after the other, 
so that her grandmother could not disappear like all the other visions. 
However, Granny did not vanish, but gazed smilingly at her. Then she opened
her arms and the little girl hugged her crying: "Granny, take me away with
you!"
   A cold day dawned and a pale sun shone on the fountain and the icy road. 
Close by lay the lifeless body of a little girl surrounded by spent matches. "
   Poor little thing!" exclaimed the passersby. "She was trying to keep warm!"
   But by that time, the little matchseller was far away where there is
neither cold, hunger nor pain.

Once upon a time... a lion decided to go to war. He summoned his ministers,
and called together his army with this proclamation: "King Lion commands taht
all animals in the forest must come before him tomorrow to go to war. Nobody
must fail to appear."
   The lion's subjects all presented themselves punctually and the lion issued
the orders: "Elephant, you're the largest, you'll transport the guns and all 
the supplies. You, fox, have a reputation for cunning, so you'll help me draw
up the plans of battle to beat off enemy attacks. You, monkey, nimble and good
at climbing trees, will act as lookout and spy the enemy's movements from 
above. Bear, you're strong and agile, so you'll scale the fortress walls and
terrorize the enemy."
   Amongst those present were also the rabbit and the donkey. When the king's
ministers saw them, they shook their heads, then one said: "Sire, I don't think
the donkey will make a good soldier. They say he is easily frightened."
   The lion looked at the donkey, then turning to his ministers, he remarked:
   "He brays louder than I can roar. He'll stay at my side and be the trumpet
that will arlly the troops."
   The ministers then pointed to the rabbit: "He's even more nervous than the
donkey. We should send him home!"
   Again the lion stood thoughtfully for a moment, then going over to the 
rabbit he said: "You always flee from your enemies, so you've learned that you
have to be faster than the others if you're to survive. So you'll act as
messenger, and within seconds, all the soldiers will receive my orders." Then,
turning to the crowd, he said: "Everyone can make himself useful in a war;
everyone can help the common cause at best he is able!" 
   Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion. 
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be 
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head 
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads 
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The 
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a 
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and 
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it 
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his 
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly 
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd 
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't 
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge 
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived. 
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas 
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe 
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey 
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap 
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish 
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he 
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch 
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was 
the only one whose animals made do without a king.
   Once upon a time . . . in the forest lived a wolf, known to be savage and 
ruthless. One day, feeling thirsty, the wolf went down to a stream, and as he 
drank the sparkling water, he saw a lamb drinking, further downstream. The 
minute he set eyes on the hapless lamb, he decided to make a meal of it. "A 
nice plump lamb! Fine and tender! Yummy! That will be deliclous! I haven't had
such luck in ages! Now, I must find an excuse for picking a quarrel, so that 
nobody can accuse me of gobbling it unjustly!"
   Unaware of the wolf, the lamb was still happily sipping the water when it 
heard a deep growl from above its head.
   "You down there! You're muddying my drinking water!"
   The lamb gasped in surprise: "I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf, but I can t possibly be 
muddying your drinking water. I'm below you and the water is flowing downhill,
not up!"
   The wicked wolf was taken aback by this reply, but only for an instant. He 
quickly hit upon another excuse to be angry. "I hear you went around six 
months ago telling people that I'm violent and a bully!"
   At that, the now frightened lamb began to tremble, and it replied in a tiny
voice: "How can you believe such a thing, Mr. Wolf? I've never said a bad word
about you! Indeed, I'll be able only to speak well of you in the future." To 
its relief, the lamb remembered that it could prove its innocence. "I wasn't 
even born six months ago! So I couldn't have spread gosslp about you."
   But the wolf was only interested in gobbling up his prey, so he hastily 
broke in: "Well, if it wasn't you, it was your father," and, pouncing on the 
little white lamb, he quickly ate it.
   Alas and alack! Innocence does not always save us from the clutches of a
tyrant.
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither. 
    He awoke feeling wonderful, with the sun bright and warm upon him 
and spring in the air. He had dozed off - for less than half-an-hour, he 
knew, because the angle of shadows from the benificent sun had changed but 
slightly while he slept - sitting upright upon the park bench; only his 
head had nodded then fallen forward.

    The park was beautiful with the green of spring, softer green than 
summer's, the day was magnificent, and he was young and in love. 
Wondrously in love, dizzily in love. And happily in love; only last night, 
Saturday night, he had proposed to Susan, and she had accepted him, more 
or less. That is, she had not given him a definite yes but she had invited 
him this afternoon to meet her family and had said that she hoped he would 
love them and that they would love him - as she did. If that wasn't 
tantamount to an acceptance, what was? They'd fallen in love at first 
sight, almost, which was why he had yet to meet her family.

    Sweet Susan, of the soft brown hair, with the cute little nose 
that was almost pug, of the faint, tender freckles and the big, soft brown 
eyes.

    She was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to him, 
that could ever happen to anyone.

    Well, it was midafternoon now and that was when Susan had asked 
him to call. He stood up from the bench and, since he found his muscles a 
bit cramped from the nap, yawned luxuriously. Then he started to walk the 
few blocks from the park where he had been killing time to the house he'd 
taken her home to last night, a short walk through the bright sunshine, 
the spring day.

    He climbed the steps and knocked on the door. It opened and for a 
second he thought Susan herself had answered it, but the girl only looked 
like Susan. Her sister, probably; she'd mentioned having a sister only a 
year older than she.

    He bowed and introduced himself, asked for Susan. He thought the 
girl looked at him strangely for a moment. Then she said, "Come in, 
please. She's not here at the moment, but if you'll wait in the parlour 
there-"

    He waited in the parlour there. How odd of her to have gone out. 
Even briefly.

    Then he heard the voice, the voice of the girl who had let him in, 
talking in the hallway outside and, in understandable curiousity, stood up 
and went to the hallway door to listen. She seemed to be talking into a 
telephone.

    "Harry - please come home right away, and bring the doctor with 
you. Yes, it's Grandpa...No, not another heart attack. Like the time 
before when he had amnesia and thought that Grandma was still - No, not 
senile dementia, Harry, just amnesia, but worse this time. Fifty years off 
- his memory is way back before he even married Grandma..."

    Suddenly old, aged fifty years in fifty seconds, he wept silently 
as he leaned against the door...
   Once upon a time . . . an elderly heron made his home in a pond full of
fish. He was stiff and slow in his old age, and he didn't find it easy to
catch his lunch.
   However, he decided to use his wits: he went to see a crab, said to be a
great chatterbox, and in a mock frightened volce, told him the latest rumour.
   "Certain birds, friends of mine, say that the lakeside fishermen will be
coming here soon with their nets. They're going to take away all the fish.
I'll have no meals left. Everything will be gone and the fish will end up in 
the frying pan!"
   The crab quickly scuttled away to the banks of the pond and dived in to
tell the fish the awful news. The frightened fish begged the crab for good
advice, and he returned to the heron.
   ". . . they're all scared stiff and don't know which way to turn. While you
yourself snap up a few now and again, it's against your interests if they go.
So what shall we do?" The heron pretended to be lost in thought. Then he said:
"I'll tell you what! I can carry them, a few at a time, to a pond hidden in
the forest. They'll be quite safe there. But will the fish trust me?"
   Whether they were scared of the fishermen, or maybe the crab had a glib
tongue, at any rate, the fish agreed to this strange offer. The heron began
his trips between pond and forest. But the crab noticed that the heron made
excuses for dallying on the way. What was more, the crab's keen eye noticed
that the heron's tummy was now a good deal plumper. Days later, when all the
fish had been rescued from the pond, the heron said to the crab: "Don't you
want to be rescued too?" he asked.
   "Certainly!" replied the crab.
   "Bend over. I'll climb on to your neck. I'd hate to make your beak tired!"
   When they were far from the pond, the crab saw that the ground was littered
with fish bones. He clung tightly to the heron's neck and said: "I've no _
intention of coming to the same end as the fish! Now, just deposit me gently
into the water. I'm not letting go of your neck till I feel safe!"
   And from that day on, crabs and herons have always loathed each other and
try to avoid meeting.
   Once upon a time there lived a young soldier named Martin who had enlisted 
in the royal army to flght a war. The war was long but victorious and when the
King abandoned the enemy's territory and returned with his troops to the 
homeland, he left Martin to guard the only bridge on the river that separated 
the two nations.
   "Stay on watch on the bridge," the King ordered. "Don't let any enemy 
soldier go by." Days and then months passed, and the soldier kept his watch on
the bridge. He survived by asking the passers-by for food and, after two 
years, thought that the authorities had probably forgotten him. He then headed
towards the capital, where he would ask the King for all his back pay. His 
pockets were empty and his only possessions were a pipe, a bit of tobacco and 
his sword.
   A couple of days later he arrived in a valley where a stream crossed his 
path. A big man with hands as big as hams, large shoulders and a bull's neck 
was sitting by the stream. The man, who had a strangely soft and kind voice, 
asked him:
   "Would you like to cross the stream?" The soldier couldn't ask for more. 
The man effortlessly uprooted a huge tree and laid it across the stream. 
Martin offered the man some of his tobacco in return and when he found out 
that the man had nothing to do, Martin asked him to come along.
   "You'll see all the things we can do together!"
   They had just begun walking away when they met a hunter who was aiming his 
rifle at a faraway hill.
   "What are you aiming at?"
   "Do you see that cobweb on that tree on top of the hill?" the hunter asked.
"I want to get the spider!" The hunter shot and when the three men got to the 
top of the hill they found a big hole in the middle of the cobweb and no more 
spider. Martin had never seen anyone shoot that well and he asked the hunter 
to join them. 
   "Come with us and you'll be in luck!" The three men walked and walked until
they arrived at a windmill. The wheel of the mill was turning even though 
there was no wind. The men were puzzled but further up the road they found a 
fat man sitting on a tree stump. The man was blowing through one of his 
nostrils in the mill's direction. The fat man explained to the three amazed 
fellow travellers that his strength was such that he could sneeze up a 
hurricane. The soldier convinced him to follow them. As they approached the 
city, they were approached by a man who hopped about with his legs tied 
together.
   "Who tied you up?" they asked in unison.
   "I did it myself," the man, who was very young and very thin, answered. "If
I untied myself I would run as fast as the wind and would not enjoy the 
sights." And so it was that even this character, nicknamed Fastfoot by the 
others, joined the group. 
   But the surprises of that extraordinary day were far from over. A little 
man with a round face sat under a tree. He held his hat over his left ear. "If
I straighten my hat," he explained, "I will freeze everything around me." 
Naturally, everybody took his word for it and the stranger was asked to join 
the group. The bizarre company finally arrived at the city. A public notice 
was hung outside the city walls. The princess announced that whoever would 
beat her in a race could marry her. 
   The soldier dusted his uniform, cleaned himself up after the long trip and 
ran to the palace. He wanted to challenge the princess but said that one of 
his servants would run in his place. The princess accepted his challenge. The 
morning after, at the starting line, Fastfoot untied his legs and took off 
like a rocket. Each one of the contestants had a jug that had to be filled at 
a nearby stream and brought back full to the finish line. On his way back, 
Fastfoot stopped to pick a flower and after carefully setting the jug on the 
ground and realizing that the princess was still far away, he decided to lie 
down and rest for a while. Unfortunately, he fell asleep.
   Later on, when the princess caught up with him and saw that he had fallen 
asleep, she kicked down his jug and ran away. She was sure of her victory. 
From far away the sharp sighted hunter shot and hit a spot near Fastfoot's 
ear. Fastfoot woke up all of a sudden and saw the princess approaching the 
finish line. He quickly ran back to the stream, filled the jug and reached the
finish line as fast as lightning. The King was furious. He would never let his
daughter marry a miserable soldier.
   He invited the unsuspecting Martin to the palace. Martin told him about his
two years watching over the river, which made the King ever angrier. The King,
however, pretended to feel guilty and invited the soldier and his friends to a
banquet in a strange dining room. In fact the dining room was lined with iron 
walls and was built over a huge furnace. The King ordered his men to seal the 
dining room's door and to light the furnace. Then he proceeded to watch the 
slow death of the group through an unbreakable glass. The six men began eating
but suddenly felt the floor grow very hot, while the room's temperature 
rapidly increased.
   But Martin did not lose his head. He straightened the hat of the round 
faced little man and pretty soon they were all shivering from the cold. The 
King uselessly urged his men to throw more and more wood in the furnace, but 
the soldier and his fnends had found a remedy to the King's wickedness. No one
had ever come out of this torture chamber alive, but this time the King had to
accept defeat, even though he was still determined not to let his daughter go.
He offered the soldier a large sum of money as long as he gave up the wedding.
   "I will fill you a bag of gold and other riches if you forget the wedding."
   "That's fine with me," Martin said, "and I accept your offer but as long as
I pick the bag and the man who will carry it away." The poor King was unaware 
of the strength of one of the six friends. When he began filling the sack, all
of his gold was not enough to fill it. Martin and his friends were rich. When 
they left court, the King had become very poor.
   The monarch lost his temper and realized the soldier had fooled him. He 
called the army commander and ordered two battalions to chase Martin. "Bring 
them back dead or alive and at all costs!" Later on, the soldiers caught up 
with the six young men and surrounded them.
   "Give us back the gold and surrender," they demanded. But the fattest of the
men began blowing so hard that horses and soldiers were carried away. In just a
few minutes the wounded soldiers were scattered all over the plain and the
battalions were no longer a threat to the six extraordinary friends who 
continued their journey. 
   Then they divided the gold and jewels in equal parts and each one of them 
went his own separate way. Martin crossed the bridge where he had been on 
watch for so long without any reward and never turned back again.
